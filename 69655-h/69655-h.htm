<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
INIGO COURT
</h3>

<p>
"It's the prettiest sport in the world," declared
Gay Lawless.  "I think Mr. Mackrell <i>just</i> got
up, don't you, Chris?"
</p>

<p>
The man looked at his companion amusedly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, but I'm no judge of <i>this</i> game,
you know."  There was a shade of contempt in
his voice.
</p>

<p>
Gay's eyes were fixed on the number board,
and she clapped her hands when No. 6 was
hoisted.
</p>

<p>
"He's won all right," she said; "he is having
his horse cooled out."  Then she had time to
remember the sneer in Chris's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I know you're mad on steeple-chasing,"
she said, tilting her nose in the air,
"but you needn't be bigoted; it's not the
only sport, and anyhow you can't deny that
Mr. Mackrell can drive; almost as well as you
can ride," she concluded generously.
</p>

<p>
Chris bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Carlton Mackrell is a brilliant whip," he
agreed, though he made a mental note that it
was about the only thing Mackrell could do.
"Let's go and congratulate him."
</p>

<p>
They left the members' enclosure, and made
their way by the side of the track to the stables,
where they found Carlton Mackrell talking to
one of his swipes.  He came to meet them, and
his dark face showed the pleasure he felt at Gay
Lawless' congratulations.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he said, "I expected to win my
heat.  Did you back my horse?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," cried the girl.  "Evidently others
besides you expected Billy Q. to win, for everyone
was backing him.  Although I got in early,
I had to lay five to two on, to five shillings," she
laughed.  "It doesn't take very much money to
paralyse the market, does it?"
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "the sight of gold creates a
panic, and an owner does not dare back his
horse personally, unless he's prepared to lay
odds on what very often is not an even money
chance.  The ring think the business is inspired,
you know," he laughed, "and begin to pinch
the price at once.  However, as I don't bet, it
doesn't affect me, though I like my friends to
help themselves whenever I run anything."
</p>

<p>
He turned to Chris Hannen, who was attentively
studying a big bay horse with the eye
of a connoisseur.  "You don't often come
trotting, do you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The two men had known each other for years,
but the fact that they both admired Gay Lawless
had not strengthened their friendship very
considerably.  Still both were sportsmen, and,
appreciated each other's talents in their respective
branches with a genuineness not met with
outside sporting circles.
</p>

<p>
"No," Chris replied, glancing at Gay from the
corner of a twinkling eye, "in fact, this is my
first appearance on a track."
</p>

<p>
"And your last, I should imagine.  You don't
look supremely happy," and Mackrell laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That's a poor compliment to me, Mr. Mackrell,"
Gay said mischievously; "you forget
Mr. Hannen is on escort duty.  It's quite by
chance he is here, but, as you know, I'm stopping
at Flytton for a few days, and Mr. Hannen
walked over from Epsom&mdash;'wasting' he calls it."
</p>

<p>
She looked reproachfully at Chris.  "There's
one advantage about trotting, anyhow&mdash;you
haven't to be perpetually worrying about your
weight, or live on lemons, and tea, and gin!"  She
made a little face.  "You must carry 10
stones 10 lbs. in a sulky, mustn't you&mdash;that's the
minimum?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, quite right," Mackrell assented, "that
enables most men to drive themselves, though a
lot employ professionals.  I can't see any fun in
the game, unless one drives one's own horses.
Let's go back, and watch the next heat.  It's a
handicap, you know, one for what the horse owners
call "pigs," he explained.  Then his face grew
serious.  "It's a pity some good men don't take
up trotting; there's no prettier sport
(unconsciously echoing Gay's opinion), and its very
much maligned because people don't understand
it, and think that <i>because</i> it's trotting, it must
necessarily be all crooked.  I don't think there's
much more finessing at it than in horse-racing, if
the truth were known, do you, Hannen?"
</p>

<p>
"I daresay not," Chris replied guardedly,
"though a lot of nonsense is talked about racing,
and the rascality of the turf, by people who have
never been near a racecourse, and who judge
racing-men as a body from the isolated cases in
the papers, in which an absconding bank-clerk
pleads betting as an excuse for defalcation!"
</p>

<p>
"Too true," said Gay, "and&mdash;why, there's my
dear old nurse in that dogcart!  I <i>must</i> speak to
her&mdash;you two go on," and she made her way
quickly to the trap, which contained a jolly,
good-natured-looking woman, whose get-up betokened
an almost too great prosperity.
</p>

<p>
Gay's grey eyes sparkled with fun and pleasure
as she came alongside, keeping just out of the
line of her old nurse's view.
</p>

<p>
"Min!" she cried
</p>

<p>
The occupant of the dogcart turned in her seat
so suddenly, as to seriously disturb the balance of
the shafts on the rail.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Gay!" she cried.  "Well, I <i>am</i>
surprised!  Fancy meeting you here!"  In a
moment she was out of the cart, and had folded
Gay to her ample bosom, while laughter and
tears chased each other alternately across her
comely face.  Gay, for her part, was every bit as
delighted to see her old nurse again, and quite
oblivious of the scene about them, they climbed
into the dogcart and sat, holding each other's
hands, and chattering as only two women can.
A great deal of what they talked about was of
interest to nobody but themselves, but the horses
racing past recalled Gay to the work in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it exciting, Min?" she cried, focussing
her glasses as they sped past the stands, and
round the bend to the back stretch.  "I think
it's ripping, and far more fun than galloping.
<i>What</i> a smash there'd be if one of these
sulkies&mdash;isn't that what they call the spider-looking
thing they sit in?&mdash;ran into each other!"
</p>

<p>
But Min did not reply.  Her eyes were riveted
on the cluster of horses drawing round the corner
into the home-stretch.
</p>

<p>
"I think we've won this," she exclaimed.
Then becoming excited she began to bounce
about in her seat.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Bob!" she cried.  "Set him alight!
Oh, don't look round, it's all your own!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, fifty yards from the judges' stand,
one of the back-markers came with a rattle wide
on the outside, the driver urging his horse with
the reins, and uttering weird cries which his
charge apparently understood, for he put in all
his knew, though, alas! he failed to "keep down,"
as they call it, and made a tangled break.
Meantime Bob was going the shortest way home,
sitting slightly forward, with his legs straight out
in front of him like the rest.
</p>

<p>
A roar from the ring proclaimed the expected
victory of yet another favourite.  Min sank back
in her seat, and her eyes shone with pride as she
said:
</p>

<p>
"Bob just got there, miss; didn't he drive
splendid?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" agreed Gay cordially.  "But who's Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Bob's my man, Miss Gay, of course!
Who else should he be?"
</p>

<p>
"Is he your husband?" Gay asked, laughing.
"I knew you were married, dear Min, but I
didn't know your husband's name.  Do introduce me."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will, miss, and feel honoured,"
Min replied proudly.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, she waved to her husband as he
walked back along the course; he handed over
his horse and sulky to a lad walking with him,
and ducking under the rails, made his way to his
wife, Min fairly beamed with pride as she said:
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Bob!  What was the time?"
</p>

<p>
Bob gave it, hugely gratified, though glancing
curiously at Gay, as she sat smiling bewitchingly
down on him.
</p>

<p>
"This is me husband, miss," Min said
affectionately.  "Mr. Bob Toplady, Miss Lawless."
</p>

<p>
Gay held out her hand to the big, jolly man.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" she said.  "I am so
pleased you won that heat, and I'm so glad, too,
to see dear Min again."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, miss," said Bob, rapidly recovering
his equanimity under Gay's unaffected
enthusiasm.  "I thought I was caught just close
home, but when I saw the other break, I knew
it was all my own.  Not that his breaking was
enough to disqualify him, you know, miss," he
explained; "he didn't do enough for that, but
because I've raced with that horse before, and I
knew he was a bad breaker."
</p>

<p>
Gay listened with all her ears, though Bob's
arguments did not seem conclusive.  Still, she
thought, there's plenty of time to learn, and she
would remember that, and ask Carlton Mackrell.
</p>

<p>
"How interesting!" she said.  "Did you win
a lot of money?"
</p>

<p>
Min laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Not a lot to you, Miss Gay," she said, "but
enough to buy me a new hat, and a bit over.  It's
only a heat, you understand, miss," she went on
to explain, "and worth five pounds to the winner.
But the final is forty pounds, and I think we
shall just about win to-day, shan't we, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, my dear," he replied, "but the
pacer that took the first heat is a bit useful, and I
know they're backing him outright.  A hobbled
pacer has a great advantage over a trotter,
especially on this uneven track."
</p>

<p>
"I must really be off now," announced Gay,
turning to embrace Min once more.  "I'll
certainly come and see you, and your husband
must tell me some more about trotting.  I have
a great mind to buy some horses myself, and run
them&mdash;though I suppose they wouldn't let me
drive, would they?" disappointedly.
</p>

<p>
"Lor, Miss Gay, what a sportsman you are!"
exclaimed Mrs. Toplady.  "Good-bye, and be
sure to let me know when I can have my little
bit on yours."
</p>

<p>
"My horses will invariably be 'out,'" Gay
answered, with a mischievous attempt at dignity.
"As Mr. Hannen would say, they will always be
'at it.'  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
Gay made her way to where Chris was leaning
over the rails, and with sparkling eyes confided
to him that she was greatly enjoying herself.
When she added that she thought of going in for
the game herself, Chris gave a long, reflective
whistle.
</p>

<p>
"I expected it," was all he said.  Perhaps his
thoughts flashed to Carlton Mackrell, and of how
much more Gay would be thrown into his
society for the future, and he remained silent till
they regained the members' enclosure.
</p>

<p>
"What will your brother say?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Frank?  Oh, he won't be consulted!  I
don't suppose he'd mind, though, so long as I am
about the place to look after him.  And he <i>does</i>
want such a lot of looking after too, Chris; you've
no idea, he's just like a child, and simply lost
away from his books and specimens.  Oh! those
dreadful specimens"&mdash;she shuddered&mdash;"he <i>will</i>
show them to me, and he leaves them about in
the most impossible places, and I <i>do</i> get such
shocks sometimes!"
</p>

<p>
"He's a clear old chap," said Chris, "and not
so very old after all, is he?  He can't be, taking
a line through you, you know," lapsing into
racing metaphor.
</p>

<p>
"He's years older than his real age, if you can
understand what I mean," Gay laughed, "and
I'm no chicken, you know, Chris&mdash;twenty-two
next birthday!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll never grow old," he replied.  "I've
known you some years now, and you haven't
changed a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Not for the better, anyhow, so Frank says,"
the girl answered.
</p>

<p>
"Frank's no judge," said Chris sharply, with
more feeling in his voice than he usually showed,
but Gay didn't seem to notice.
</p>

<p>
"Here comes Mr. Mackrell," she said, as a
sulky swept past, going round the track for a
warm up, before the second bell rang for the
drivers to get on their marks.
</p>

<p>
Chris looked on without any interest.
</p>

<p>
"Take 'em out of those beetle-traps, and put a
few fences across the course, then you might see
something worth looking at," was his private
opinion of trotting, yet the pacer's speed is
founded on the camel's, and weedy and lanky
as he is, no one who has seen either a trotter or
a pacer fully extended in a race, especially if he
has watched it coming straight at him, will
deny that he is hardly less beautiful when in
motion, than miserable-looking when he stands
inactive.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, the second bell rang, and
the drivers proceeded to their respective marks,
some in receipt of a start, others giving one.
Carlton Mackrell was on the back mark; the
horse he was driving was amongst the fastest
milers in England, and his form was fully exposed,
with the result that he never improved appreciably
on his handicap, as he was always trying, and
frequently too close to the winner (often thrown
in on previous "judicious form") to be re-handicapped.
</p>

<p>
The aim of all the drivers was to poach a start,
and they turned, and came up to their marks
with the pace up, so that at the sound of the
"off" bell their horses were in their stride.
The flag-man opposite each, raised his flag the
moment the horse he was watching was on his
mark, and lowered it when he had overstepped it.
</p>

<p>
After five or six attempts, "Uncle," the starter,
with his finger on the trigger of his revolver, saw
that all the flags were raised at the same time,
and in a second, bang! and they were off.  Gay's
eyes were fixed on Carlton Mackrell.
</p>

<p>
"He's well away," she announced eagerly.
</p>

<p>
There were few better hands at getting off
smartly than Mackrell, and he was always fairly
going as he reached his distance, timing to a
nicety the manœuvrings of his rivals in front.
</p>

<p>
"That's the one advantage of being 'scratch,'"
he always said, "you can see what the others are
doing."
</p>

<p>
In the first round he caught four of the leaders,
though one, a hobbled pacer under saddle, ridden
by a small boy, with a start of fifty yards, was
apparently keeping it.  Going round the back
stretch the second time, Carlton Mackrell set his
horse going, and began to go after the leader.
Approaching the straight, shouts of "Billy Q."
and "Sam Sly" rent the air, while the two horses
were home-locked together.
</p>

<p>
Those who knew Carlton Mackrell's style of
driving, however, and how he liked to come with
a rush on the post, slipped down off the stand and
backed him.  Twenty yards from the post&mdash;too
late, it appeared to Gay, who was exhorting him
under her breath to "go on"&mdash;he made his effort.
It was all over in a few strides, and Billy Q. had
won.
</p>

<p>
Gay walked to the gate of the enclosure,
followed by Chris, and waited while Carlton
Mackrell got down.  In a few minutes the flag
was hung out of the judge's box and the "all
right" shouted to the ring.  Emerging from
the stable, he handed his rugged-up winner to
an attendant, and slipping on his overcoat, he
walked along the track, his eyes on the ground,
thinking, not of his recent triumph, but of Gay
Lawless.  By nature a most undemonstrative
man, he rarely showed visibly any emotion, either
on the course or in private, but his colour rose as
he thought what a good sort Gay was, what a pal
she'd make to the right man.  But who was the
right man?  Had he arrived yet, and if so, was
he personified in Chris Hannen, or had he, Carlton
Mackrell, any chance?  He started, as close at
hand Gay's soft, clear voice exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Well done again, Mr. Mackrell!  You drew
it rather fine, though, didn't you?  I thought
you wouldn't quite get there, and I was so
excited."
</p>

<p>
Carlton stopped, his features breaking into one
of those rare smiles that transformed his dark,
handsome face.
</p>

<p>
"I always like to make a race of it, you know,"
he replied.  "You see, I know my horses so well;
nobody drives them but me, even in their work,
and my wrist-watch"&mdash;he held his arm up&mdash;"tells
me exactly how fast I am going, and if my horse
keeps to his home time for the quarter and half
miles, I know I shall be thereabouts at the
finish."
</p>

<p>
Gay's eyes sparkled.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> enjoyed to-day so much," she said,
"and I'm regularly bitten with trotting.  It's
<i>much</i> prettier to watch than racing&mdash;even over
fences"&mdash;she glanced saucily at Chris&mdash;"and,
Mr. Mackrell, I'll let you into a secret&mdash;I mean to buy
some horses, and go in for the game!  Will you
help me choose them, or let me know when
anything good comes into the market?"
</p>

<p>
Mackrell looked earnestly at the girl's eager
face, then he glanced quickly at Chris.  That
gentleman's face expressed no opinion, presenting
the stoic indifference that characterised equally
his riding of a winner, or another disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"This is hardly a lady's game, you know,"
Mackrell protested, "and, fond as I am of it,
I could not recommend you to take it up
seriously.  The surroundings are not quite of
the same class as Ascot or Goodwood, you
know, and you would be an isolated instance."
</p>

<p>
"Wear your plainest clothes, no ornaments,
and bring no money with you," had been
Carlton's significant instructions when Gay had
expressed a wish to attend a trotting meeting&mdash;and
who could possibly have expected that
horses, everything, would appear to her under a
rose-hued glamour that assuredly they did not
possess?  Gay did not notice the component
elements of the crowd, as Chris did&mdash;the weather
was dazzling, the sun cozened, illumined the
scene, and with a lover on either side of her to
make things pleasant, the novelty of everything
intoxicated her.  Trotting showed to her in most
attractive guise, and very differently to how it
did later.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care," she said wilfully, "I'm fond of
it, and I mean to do it, so <i>that's</i> settled.  If you
give me the benefit of your experiences"&mdash;she
turned to Carlton&mdash;"I shall be grateful, and I
won't be more of a nuisance than I can help."
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell bowed.
</p>

<p>
"You could never be a nuisance," he said
gravely, "and my advice is always at your
command."
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately after he left them, and full
of her delightful project, escorted by Chris Hannen,
Gay Lawless left the pretty little racecourse.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
A MAN OF SCIENCE
</h3>

<p>
Professor Lawless was a scientist, and, as is
common among professors and scientists, very
eccentric.  A Bachelor of Medicine, he had
practised as much or as little as pleased him, and
devoted most of his time to the materialisation of
experiments that, if perfected, would make his
fortune.
</p>

<p>
Not that it was with this end in view that he
laboured, for his means were considerable, and it
was his custom to give his services and advice to
patients gratis in the majority of cases, although
his sister Gay was no advocate of this practice.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you put up a notice with "Free
Hospital" on it over the door, and have done
with the farce of refusing to take fees from
people who can well afford them?" she used to
ask indignantly.  "You forget that it cost a
heap of money during the five years you were
learning the little you now know"&mdash;she laughed,
for he was really a walking encyclopædia of
learning&mdash;"and do you intend to get none of it
back?"
</p>

<p>
Her brother would beam at her through the
glasses that were eternally slipping off his nose.
</p>

<p>
"You are too commercial, Gay," he said.
"None of us are infallible, and it would pain me
to think that I had taken money for what might,
after all, have been a mistaken diagnosis.  I
have ample means for my wants&mdash;which are
simple&mdash;and I disapprove strongly of the tactics
employed by some medical men in accepting fees
for ailments which are often imaginary, and more
often curable by fresh air and exercise than
drugs and knives."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're hopeless," Gay rejoined, and
there the argument ended for the time being,
much to the Professor's satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
A remarkably handsome and intellectual-looking
man, tall, but with a slight stoop, and
with far-away, clear blue eyes that narrowed
habitually whenever he looked at anything,
possibly through years of close microscopic work,
Frank Lawless had a personality (if an untidy
one, as Gay said) that compelled people to ask,
"Who is that man?"
</p>

<p>
He seldom left his laboratory and books,
though occasionally Gay prevailed upon him to
accompany her to some function or other, when
he donned a dress-suit of archaic pattern, and,
after spoiling a dozen ties, and wandering
miserably in and out of his sister's room to ask if
"this will do?" waited patiently in the hall,
with an obsolete opera-hat held gingerly in one
hand, the while he read from a scientific treatise
held close to his eyes in the other.
</p>

<p>
A habit of standing first on one leg, and then
on the other, had earned him the nickname of
"Heron," and it was thus disrespectfully, but
affectionately, that his sister usually addressed
him.  A man of unbounded possibilities, but
indifferent achievements, only a total lack of
ambition and enterprise prevented his rolling the
ball still at his feet, but, as it was, he had never
improved on the fame that came to him when
quite a young man.
</p>

<p>
"The first man in England on his subject,"
was what his colleagues said of him, "but doesn't
seem to push his opportunities; nice fellow,
too!" while Frank Lawless himself, after a
merciless tirade from Gay, would remark:
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I have used my brains to the best
of my ability.  My name is not unknown, and
there are some eminent men who seek my opinion
still, and value it.  I do not wish to become a
public character&mdash;to be obscure is to be happy&mdash;why
not leave me to the work I love?  I do not
remember an instance in which I have interfered
with you, though I must confess that some of
your exploits&mdash;notably hunting, a practice I
detest&mdash;have caused me some anxiety.  Live
and let live, my child," and waving a hand that
clasped a test-tube, the Professor would flee to
the safety of the laboratory, to which haven Gay
never intruded, the smells were too awful, she
said.
</p>

<p>
Since the death of their parents, Gay had taken
up her abode with her brother in London.  The
girl was really very fond of him, and though they
had few tastes in common, she thought it her
duty, as well as her pleasure, to look after him,
and, as she expressed it, "dress and wash him up
generally."
</p>

<p>
The arrangement answered admirably.  Gay
was free as air to go where she liked, and do
what she pleased, while the Professor followed
his own pursuits, and took a secret delight in
being well taken care of, without having to suffer
the infliction of a wife.
</p>

<p>
In fact, so secure did he feel under existing
circumstances, that the prospect of their
interruption sometimes occurred to him with an
unpleasant shock, and the possibility of his sister
marrying appalled him.  He consoled himself,
however, with the reflection that she seemed in
no hurry, and no one could accuse him of
attempting to cross bridges before he met them;
his character was rather the reverse, in fact, his
impulse being to walk round any obstacle that
presented itself, or if this proved impossible, to
confront it sideways, and wait till either it
removed itself, or someone&mdash;usually Gay&mdash;came
to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
This disinclination to show a bold front to
however trivial a difficulty, was the twin trait to
his lack of ambition, and his attitude was pathetic
when a worldly problem faced him, for he could
no more reprimand or dismiss a worthless
servant, than he could in cold blood destroy
one of his cherished specimens.
</p>

<p>
"She does her best, poor thing!"  It was thus
he one day mildly excused an obstreperous and
drunken cook, who had "held up" the whole
household.  "It must be very trying to stand
over a fire all day, you know, and, er&mdash;she's only
a little excited, is she?"
</p>

<p>
"She's drunk," Gay said emphatically.  "She
went for Sanders with the rolling-pin just now.
I want you to see her, and tell her that if she's
not out of the house, bag and baggage, in an
hour, you'll send for the police."
</p>

<p>
This was, of course, a joke, but Gay spoke so
seriously, and appeared so much in earnest, that
the Professor felt in immediate danger of
participating in a scene, and looked all the fright
he felt.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, my dear, if you think a man's&mdash;and
a firm man's (the Professor looked more
like a jelly just then)&mdash;intervention is desirable, I
will speak to the cook, and if necessary (he
squared his champagne shoulders, and Gay
almost laughed as she fancied she heard
something crack) I will show her the door."
</p>

<p>
He looked supplicatingly at Gay, and sidled
towards the nearest exit himself.
</p>

<p>
"If you want me," he continued hurriedly, "I
shall be in my laboratory; I am in the middle of
a very delicate experiment," and with the last
words, his coat-tails vanished round the corner.
Gay smiled as she heard the laboratory door
hastily closed, and the key turned.
</p>

<p>
"Old funk!" she said elegantly.  "Afraid of
his own shadow!  I do believe he'd rather be
run over than hold up his hand, for fear of hurting
the motor-man's feelings!"
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed, and proceeded downstairs
to tackle the cook herself.
</p>

<p>
The breakfast-room in Connaught Square was
a pleasant apartment, and on the morning after
the Trotting Meeting, when Frank had finished
breakfast, and taken up his customary morning
attitude before the fire, Gay leaned her elbows on
the table, framed her pretty, fresh face in the
hollow of her hands, and opened the ball.
</p>

<p>
"Frank, dear," she said, "I have something
to tell you."
</p>

<p>
The Professor passed his hand lightly over his
face, touching it in three places.  He always did
this when his attention was required, and many
people thought he was crossing himself, and
unjustly suspected him of ritualistic tendencies.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear?" he inquired.  "Nothing
unpleasant, I hope?"  Turning to the glass he
looked apprehensively at his sister's reflection,
and was discomfited when she caught him.
</p>

<p>
"Quite the reverse," she said.  "It's this:
I'm going to buy and race some Trotting horses!"
</p>

<p>
And now, thought she, for a homily on sport
and the evils of the turf!  But she was disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"Why specify the horse with a superfluous
adjective?" he inquired.  "All horses trot, don't
they?  It is their natural pace&mdash;or one of them.
Try to be accurate, my dear girl."
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"Trotting horses are a distinct breed, old boy,"
she said, "and they trot against each other for
prizes; <i>trot</i>, you understand, or pace&mdash;there are
square-gaited horses&mdash;those that trot like a
cab-horse, only faster, you know&mdash;and pacers, which
move both legs on the same side in unison.  Like
this, you know"&mdash;she got up from her chair, and
tried to illustrate her meaning by walking across
the room, moving the right arm and right leg
together, repeating the performance on the left side.
</p>

<p>
Frank Lawless looked on with suddenly
awakened scientific interest.
</p>

<p>
"I was under the impression that only giraffes
moved in that way," he said.  "Surely horses
cannot go very fast with an action like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Fast enough to do a mile in one minute
fifty-five seconds or less, anyway," Gay replied.  "It
is such a pretty sight to watch, they wear such
funny boots sometimes, and hobbles and sheepskins,
and&mdash;and&mdash;things," she finished lamely
for want of more knowledge regarding pacers'
equipment.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes, quite so," Frank Lawless agreed,
"but&mdash;er&mdash;racing, you know.  My experience of
it has been limited, I confess, (the Professor's
knowledge of racing was confined to two or
three occasional turfites who came to him
professionally), but I am given to understand that
its followers are, to say the least of it,
unscrupulous.  I am not a prig, Gay, but I have
seen life in my time"&mdash;he looked at himself
knowingly in the glass, while Gay laughed
inwardly&mdash;"and I flatter myself I am a man of
the world, therefore I fear I cannot give my
consent to your proposal."
</p>

<p>
The last remark was uttered with all the
timidity of an assumed authority, and as he spoke,
he lapsed into the one-legged attitude which had
earned him his nickname.
</p>

<p>
"My proposal, as you call it, is a foregone
conclusion, dear Heron," Gay answered smartly,
"and with all sisterly respect for you, I would
remark that I invariably make up my mind&mdash;both
our minds sometimes&mdash;beforehand, and acquaint
you with the result after.  Carlton Mackrell has
promised me his assistance and advice, and as
soon as I can get hold of a few good horses, I
mean to start.  The Trotting season's young yet&mdash;perhaps
later on, as a special treat, I'll take you
to see a race."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mackrell?" he said irritably.  "Well,
well, a rich idler is bound to take up some fad, I
suppose&mdash;but why be a sporting man, without
two ideas in your head?  An interesting animal,
no doubt, of the same type as your friend, Chris
Hannen, but&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Gay with spirit, for she resented
the sneer, "it's these 'interesting animals,' as
you are pleased to call them, from the lofty
heights of ineffectual science, who do the work of
the world, the work that counts.  It is the
sportsmen of England who know how to rise to
an emergency, and overcome it, old boy&mdash;these
very same brainless men whom you so
contemptuously patronise, by their pluck and
determination, form the very bulwark of England
when fighting has to be done!"
</p>

<p>
"But I fail to see any object in sport," reiterated
her brother obstinately, "especially horse-racing
and&mdash;er&mdash;Trotting matches.  Where does
it lead to, and what good purpose does it serve?"
</p>

<p>
"It improves the breed of a noble animal, and
teaches the men who ride it self-reliance and
resource," Gay flashed back, "to say nothing of
making them <i>hard</i>&mdash;a soft man is every decent
woman's abomination!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor shifted his feet uneasily, and
glanced at his watch; it was his invariable rule
to run away when getting the worst of an
argument.  He had no power to hinder Gay
from making ducks and drakes of her two
thousand a year, and he sighed as he reflected
that she was already more than a little original in
some of her ideas and speech; but he also knew
that the charm of the girl overshadowed all else,
and that whatever she said or did, seldom drew
forth a more severe censure than "Oh, that's
Gay Lawless all over, you know," from anyone
whose opinion mattered.
</p>

<p>
Gay, in fact, possessed a soul which she
described as "superior to public opinion or
example&mdash;good or bad, especially good," and
so long as what she said and did harmed no
one, and she performed such duties as her station
required of her, she felt answerable to none.
</p>

<p>
When he had left the room with his usual
silent shuffle, the girl, quite unconscious of the
pretty picture she made, talked confidentially
to her reflection in the glass.
</p>

<p>
"Awful pity dear old Frank isn't more of an
outdoor man," she said aloud, then her face grew
serious as she remembered the fate of her four
other brothers, all killed in the open, two fighting,
and two in search of adventure.
</p>

<p>
"He's the only one of us all without the
sporting instinct, and what's worse, is bigoted
against every kind of sport for others.  He can't
help his nature, I suppose; but oh! I <i>do</i> wish he
could understand all that the sight of the country,
and growing things, and horses mean to me!"
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously Gay for a long time had felt
the want of a sympathetic companion, or, as
she would have expressed it, a pal, for, fond as
she was of her brother, he was not an ideal
listener when she lived over again a great run
to hounds, or described a spirited game of polo
at Hurlingham.
</p>

<p>
He always accorded her that polite inattention
which checks confidences, and freezes
enthusiasm, and Lossie Holden, Gay's cousin
and enforced intimate, loathed sport in every
shape and form, while Effie Bulteel, a sportswoman
after Gay's own heart, was too constantly
her husband's companion to have much time for
anyone else.  Thus, on the principle that we are
nearly always furthest from those we love, Gay
did not see half so much of her friend as she
wished, while having to endure far more of her
cousin Lossie's company than she either desired
or deserved.
</p>

<p>
Dismissing the subject with a shrug of her
shoulders, the girl started to attend to those
household duties in which she was an adept, and
retired below stairs to plan out the day's food,
more especially the dinner.  Then she did the
flowers, of which there was always a profusion in
the house, for Gay was a real lover of Nature,
and to watch the different gradations of colour in
the spring was a constant delight to her, though
when leaf and flower came to their full growth and
perfection, all rushing out on the top of each
other, she lost interest in, and quaintly denounced
them, as "vulgar."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly it occurred to her that she and Frank
had not given one of their cosy little dinners for
some time&mdash;why not have one soon, asking
Carlton Mackrell and Chris Hannen, with the
inevitable Lossie to make up the party?  The
Professor did not count, and in any case Gay
would have found it difficult to find another
girl&mdash;all those she knew were either too fast or too
slow for her taste, and it must be confessed that
while she bore her own sex no ill-will, she
infinitely preferred the society of men.
</p>

<p>
"You can never tell a woman all your secrets
as you can a man," she used to say, and Lossie
was fond of quoting this remark, and telling
everyone that Gay hated women&mdash;the deduction
being that from close personal observation of her
own character, she found all her sisters as hateful
as herself.
</p>

<p>
Yet Gay looked no "cat" as she ran to her
writing-table; in these days when the streets are
filled with fine athletic woman, but the dear little
girl, with her smile, her blush, her little foot and
hand, her gracious ways, her thanks for some
small service rendered, appears to have vanished
from the haunts of men, one such girl at least, as
more than one man knew, was to be found at a
certain house in Connaught Square.
</p>

<p>
When she had penned the three invitations,
she fell to thinking, then presently destroyed two
out of the three she had written.
</p>

<p>
"Carlton Mackrell shall come alone, and
convert Frank," she said aloud; "besides, he and
Chris would be sure to fall out over the rival
merits of racing and trotting"; but she sighed
as she rang for the letter to be posted.
</p>

<p>
For Chris was such rattling good company, he
would describe things in a manner that brought
tears of laughter into the eyes of his listeners,
such readiness, such a knack of creating sunshine
wherever he went, Gay never found in anyone
else&mdash;it was a mere coincidence, of course, that
he found no other company in the world so
delightful as Gay's!
</p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
"TROTTING <i>VERSUS</i> RACING."
</h3>

<p>
"Are you still of the same mind about
Trotting?" Carlton Mackrell asked Gay as they
sat at the dainty, rose-lit table of the dining-room
in Connaught Square a few nights later.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!" Gay said reproachfully.
"I <i>never</i> change my mind once it's made up, do
I, dear?" and she appealed to her brother.
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked at her with his soup
spoon poised between his plate and his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Never</i> is a very positive statement," he said,
"but I think you are fairly consistent when you
have made up what you are pleased to <i>call</i> your
mind, Gay."
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell glanced at the girl, then at
her brother, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
What a contrast these two were, to be sure!
Gay, so full of life, and fun, and spirits, bent on
finding and enjoying all the good things of the
world, without a care, apparently, and her
brother, a prematurely aged, dry-as-dust specimen,
with no ambition whatever beyond his musty
books, and test-tubes, and things, and with a
precision of thought and speech that must surely
get on Gay's nerves terribly!
</p>

<p>
Doubtless the man had his good points, but it
was an axiom of Carlton's, that unless a person's
virtues struck one at once, life was too short to
waste in trying to discover them.  As a practical
man about town&mdash;and there is no finer school
for the observation of character than cosmopolitan
society&mdash;he had learnt to "size-up," as he
expressed it, a man on sight, and only on rare
occasions had to acknowledge to a mistake.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how you came to take up Trotting,
Mr. Mackrell?  It's much safer, don't you think,
than 'chasing?'" said Gay, as she helped herself
from a dish handed by a particularly pretty
parlour-maid.  "Mr. Hannen <i>loves</i> it&mdash;but gets
more hard knocks than ha'pence.  After a more
than usually crushing 'downer,' in which his
head suffered most, he was warned last year by
an eminent specialist that another tap on the
same spot would probably prove fatal&mdash;"  She
paused abruptly as the Professor nodded.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to explain how his nod
expressed the opinion that another such fatality
would be well deserved, but it did, and Gay's eyes
flashed whole volumes of indignation that did not
escape Carlton&mdash;he loved a woman of spirit.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I ever told you of my first real
introduction to Trotting, and how it came
about?" he said, breaking a rather strained
silence, and Gay shook her head, while the
Professor, with some ostentation, devoted
himself to his dinner.
</p>

<p>
"I found myself at Southend, the place where
the mud is, you know, and having nothing to do
one afternoon&mdash;did you speak, sir?" as his host
muttered something <i>sotto voce</i> about Satan and
idle hands, and Carlton at once decided to inflict
on the spoil-sport Professor, the punishment of
hearing the whole story to the bitter end.  He
was rewarded by a delighted gleam in Gay's eye,
as he imperturbably proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"I heard some Trotting races were on, and
thought I'd go and see them.  While watching
the toilet of a horse about to run&mdash;or trot,
a horsey-looking individual spoke to me, and
though I had never set eyes on him before, he
appeared to know me perfectly."
</p>

<p>
The Professor coughed.  If ever a cough said
"birds of a feather," his did then, but Carlton
ignored it.
</p>

<p>
"'Good-day, Mr. Mackrell,' said the unknown,
pulling his cap, 'and what might you be doin' at
<i>this</i> game?'  I liked the look of the old chap,
somehow&mdash;he was fairly long in the tooth, I must
tell you&mdash;so I explained that having nothing to
do, I had come to see the Trotting.  'I think,'
said my unknown, 'as I can do you a bit o' good
'ere this afternoon.  There's a 'orse goin' to be
sold after the second race to-day&mdash;owner's taken
the merry rat-tat, you see, sir&mdash;an' if you can get
'im for anything below seventy quid, <i>buy</i> 'im.
I've been Trottin' an' drivin' 'em a good many
years now, an' I know all about this 'orse.  'E's
sound in wind an' limb, an' money wouldn't buy
'im if it wasn't a case of couldn't 'elp it, <i>'ad</i> to.'"
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed, highly amused.  "Well?" she
said, while the Professor, with the air of a god in
the clouds, who leans over to observe the absurd
antics of the human ants below, resignedly helped
himself to more salad.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," Carlton continued, "I recognised
'the tale' when I heard it, and naturally
supposed my new-found friend had an axe to grind,
but his next remark disabused my mind."
</p>

<p>
"'I shan't get nothin' out o' the deal, guv'nor,'
he said.  'You'll pay yer brass straight over to
the auctioneer, an' I don't suppose 'e'll give me
anything if you buy the 'orse, any more than if
anyone else did&mdash;an' somebody <i>will</i> if you don't
watch it, though there ain't much money 'ere
to-day,' looking at the crowd disparagingly.
'This 'orse is in the last race, the open, with
thirty-five quid to the winner, an' 'e can win it
too, off the mark 'e's got to-day.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, to cut a long story short," Mackrell
went on, dexterously combining enjoyment of a
good dinner with his recital, "I <i>did</i> buy the
horse for sixty-five guineas, and there I was,
landed with probably a bad bargain&mdash;though I
liked the make and shape of him, mind you, but
with no earthly idea what to do with him."
</p>

<p>
"Marry in haste, repent at leisure," said the
Professor.  "I mean&mdash;&mdash;"  But Carlton did not
stop to inquire what the Professor meant, only
Gay realised that the "conversion" she had
hoped for was far away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my unknown again came to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"'Borrow a sulky off of the man you bought
'im from,' he advised.  ''E'll lend it yer, for
'e's a sport&mdash;that's why 'e's taken the knock, I
shouldn't wonder,' he added reflectively.  Sure
enough, the late owner of my purchase lent me
his sulky, and he and my friend harnessed the
horse to it for me when his race came on.
Imagine my astonishment when the horsey-looking
man put a whip into my hand, and
said, 'Up you git, sir, an' drive the old boiler
yourself.  All <i>you</i> are to do is to sit where you
are, an' leave 'is 'ead alone.  'E'll do the
rest, an' you'll win as far as from 'ere to
London.'"
</p>

<p>
"Which was not <i>much</i>!" flashed Gay mirthfully.
</p>

<p>
"I expressed considerable doubt as to the
success of this plan, you may be sure," Mackrell
went on, "but the man would take no denial, and
before I knew where I was, I had received the
promise of a driver's licence from the Committee,
and permission to begin then and there, and was
on my mark, bewildered with the counsellings of
my mentor.
</p>

<p>
"'This 'orse 'as forgotten more about Trottin'
than you'll ever know, guv'nor,' he said.  'Just
sit still, and leave the rest to 'im.  And look 'ere,
you're goin' to back 'im, of course?'  I handed
over a five pound note, and my man darted off
to the Ring with it, returning before we were
off.  'I've got Sevens'es to your bit,' he told
me.  '<i>Don't</i> look at me&mdash;get as near yer mark as
you can, and keep on the move.'"
</p>

<p>
"But you had time to jump off!" cried the
Professor, his voice rising to a squeal of
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"At that moment the bell rang," went on
Carlton, "and my horse shot forward, and got
into his stride at once, followed by shouts to me
of, 'Don't pull 'im about, for Gawd's sake!  Give
'im 'is 'ead!'"
</p>

<p>
Carlton stopped to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"It was not a case of <i>giving</i>," he said, "the
horse took it&mdash;and my arms as well, all but.
However, I did as I was told, and we won
pretty easily by a length, though I was indeed a
'passenger' on that trip!  Directly after the race,
my friend rejoined me.
</p>

<p>
"'Well done!' he said, 'though I thought you
was goin' to fall out round that last bend.'  He
patted the horse affectionately.  'Wot did I tell
yer?' he asked.  ''Ere's yer money&mdash;forty quid.
Now see what yer can buy this sulky for,' and
he dragged me over to the owner of it.  Enquiry
elicited the fact that five pounds would buy it.
My mentor whispered in my ear, 'Offer to toss
'im eighty or nothin',' he said; 'yer luck's in
to-day, guv'nor, an' 'e's a sportsman.'  I proposed
this plan, and it was accepted.  I won, and so
found myself the possessor of a good Trotting
horse, the winner of a race, plus thirty-five pounds
in bets, and the owner of a sulky&mdash;nearly new&mdash;and
all for a fiver!"
</p>

<p>
"How ripping!" exclaimed Gay, "and how lucky!"
</p>

<p>
"Most remarkable," the Professor concurred
dryly.  "It was your monetary good fortune,
then, that decided you to make a hobby of
Trotting?"
</p>

<p>
Carlton looked the Professor over as if he were
some disagreeable specimen.
</p>

<p>
"Chiefly, I think, because I saw an opportunity
of following the advice of Miss Gay, who
had advised me to take up a hobby."
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Shortly after, I bought some more horses,
and have had no reason to regret it&mdash;they have
won a good few races, and just about paid their
way.  I've got my eye on the chief Trotting
Prize&mdash;Champion Vase they call it"&mdash;he turned
to Gay&mdash;"this year, and I think I shall go very
close for it."
</p>

<p>
"How I should love to win that!" Gay cried
eagerly.  "Do you think I could buy anything
good enough to have a chance too?"
</p>

<p>
"You're flying at high game for a beginner,"
laughed Mackrell, "but if you're really in
earnest"&mdash;Gay nodded emphatically&mdash;"I'll keep my eyes
open, and let you know if I hear of anything.
You will have to give a stiffish price for a
'green' or unexposed horse with a record of
2.20 trotting or 2.10 pacing, probably about four
or five hundred pounds."
</p>

<p>
The Professor gave a startled, hurried glance
at his sister.  He regarded all money spent on
anything but comfort, and books, which ranked
certainly before necessaries with him, as thrown
into the gutter.
</p>

<p>
His and Gay's modest stable arrangements
were limited when in town&mdash;for she only hunted
in the country&mdash;to a handsome mare that she
drove in a smart Ralli car, and which attracted
no particular attention save as being driven by a
pretty girl, except when the Professor
accompanied her.
</p>

<p>
Then, clutching in an unsportsmanlike way
at the reins, shutting his eyes at dangerous
crossings, and screaming out impossible directions
to which Gay turned a deaf ear, his antics
convulsed all beholders, and made her blush for
shame.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she said, not surprised by any
means at the price Mackrell mentioned, "I know
good horses cost money, and that I can't win
anything with bad ones.  By the way, what
happened to your friend who made you buy
your first horse?"
</p>

<p>
"I took him home with me," Carlton Mackrell
replied, "and installed him as my trainer.  His
name is Tugwood, and I found out that he had
had great experience of training and driving
Trotters; twenty-five years of it, in fact, both in
America and here.  He is still with me, and
drives when I am unable to do so myself, which
is not often, happily.  Of course you will want a
trainer&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can you find me one?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so"; but he did not tell her that he
meant to transfer "Brusher" Tugwood to her
as the most trustworthy man he knew, and in
whose hands her horses would be treated as
carefully and as jealously as were his own.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully interesting," said Gay with a sigh.
"How I wish I were a man, to be able to go
about, and get some of these experiences.
Nearly all amusing, aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Mostly," Carlton Mackrell replied, crumbling
his bread thoughtfully, "though a few are sad,
and many sordid."
</p>

<p>
He went away that night, knowing that he
should have kicked himself for a sweep in
encouraging Gay in her new passion, for the scales
had already fallen from his eyes as regarded
Trotting, but, doting on the girl as he did, her
wish was law to him, while the prospect of getting
her to himself while Chris was racing elsewhere,
was too great a temptation to resist.
</p>

<p>
And after all, why should she not have her
fling?  She could afford it, and the time she put
in with the noxious Professor must be dull enough
in all conscience.
</p>

<p>
When at last, excited and happy, Gay betook
herself to bed, she dreamed of new records created
by her horses, and saw her sideboard covered with
cups, king over which reigned the Blue Riband
of Trotting, the Champion Gold Vase.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
"A RACING MAN"
</h3>

<p>
Right on the top of Epsom Downs, and "far
from the madding crowd," as he expressed it,
was Chris Hannen's training stable.
</p>

<p>
A pretty red-and-white house, gabled, with
old-fashioned diamond-paned windows, it stood
at the top of a lawn (on which in the summer
Chris played sundry hard sets of tennis to keep
himself fit), surrounded by trees which served as
a protection from the prevailing winds in the
winter.
</p>

<p>
So keen and pure, indeed, was the air on the
Downs, that when he took the house, Chris
renamed it "The Breezes," and as a training
centre the position was ideal.  Immediately
outside the front gate were the Downs to gallop
over, while behind the house was a spacious
schooling-ground, with fac-similes of all the
fences to be met with on a race-course.
</p>

<p>
They were always kept stiffly built-up, too, for
it was a sound maxim of Chris's never to allow
his horses to get slovenly in their jumping,
through being practised over weak fences.  He
knew from experience that horses so indulged
were very apt to "chance" their fences in public,
and races were not won under such conditions.
Therefore every attention was paid to his
schooling-ground, and the percentage of winners
turned out from the little stable was wonderful
considering the strength of it, and bore testimony
to the painstaking way in which they were
prepared.
</p>

<p>
Chris owed much of his success to a knowledge
of the art of placing his horses where they could
perform to the best advantage.  He sometimes
had a difficulty in persuading the owner of a bad
horse that he would never win the Grand National
with it, and on one or two occasions, having done
his best with hopeless cases, their owners had
removed them to another trainer, only to discover
the truth of Chris's judgment, and the folly of
incurring further expense in vain attempts to
win races.
</p>

<p>
Chris regarded an increase in his horses with
satisfaction, and a decrease with equanimity.
He was not dependent upon training horses for
a living, for he had a private income of a few
hundreds a year, and after a couple of years in
the Army had gone in for it more as a hobby to
which he was devoted, than anything else.  He
generally had three or four horses of his own at
Epsom, and an equal number of his friends', but
never more than ten or twelve in his stables at
most, as he was of opinion that a man could not
do justice to a greater number, studying each
individually, and becoming acquainted with their
peculiarities, often very useful knowledge when
riding them in public.
</p>

<p>
It was regarded as a privilege to have a horse
or two with Chris, for an owner always felt assured
that they could not be in more competent hands,
and the amateur's independent position precluded
the possibility of a horse being run to suit the
stable rather than the owner.
</p>

<p>
Chris's popularity with both sexes was general,
and occasionally he had a horse belonging to a
sporting member of the fair sex.  He found it
hard sometimes to convince the latter that her
horse was not within some stones of the Sandown
Grand Annual Steeplechase form, and he was
strong in his refusal to encourage useless waste of
money in travelling expenses.  He had incurred
the momentary displeasure of a lady with sporting
ambitions by informing her that, after many
experiments, he was forced to the conclusion that
her horse could not win a saddle and bridle
at a country fair, if a decent proportion of the
other runners were trying, but no one was ever
angry with Chris for long.  His imperturbable
good temper and quaint humour invariably came
to the rescue, and his opinion on the merits or
otherwise of a horse was consistently borne out.
</p>

<p>
"I am unlikely to entertain an angel unawares,"
he once said to a disappointed owner, "and it is
my custom to give every horse more than one
chance.  But, on the other hand, it is not my
practice to keep horses belonging to other people
in my stable when I know they are worthless.  I
do not keep 'stumers' myself for longer than I
can help, though I'm pleased to say I do not often
buy them either, so why should I delude other
people into doing so?  Your horse, my dear sir,
would be better employed in some less ambitious
sphere than a race-course, and, without wishing
to hurt your feelings&mdash;and they are very sore, I
know, when the brutal truth is driven home by a
sympathetic but conscientious outsider&mdash;I would
suggest that you cut your losses, and send him up
to Tattersall's as a light-weight hunter for a
galloping country like Leicestershire.  There are
many ten-stone hunting men who love a bit of
blood to chase a fox upon, and your horse is at
least sound."
</p>

<p>
On this particular day the morning's work was
over, and Chris and his head lad, (who was
universally and impartially known as Scotty,
though the presumption was that he had been
christened something else originally) were
standing in the box of a horse, looking on while he
was being dressed down, and discussing the
results of a trial from which he had lately
emerged triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"It makes the 'andicap Steeple at Kempton
look pretty good for 'im, sir," the head lad was
saying; "'e showed up well the first time we
tried 'im, an' there can be no mistake this time
either, with old Evergreen in the gallop.  'E's a
wonderful good trial 'oss, an' I never expected
the young 'un to give 'im weight and a clever
beatin'.'"
</p>

<p>
Chris agreed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very pleased with him," he said; "the
further he went, the better he seemed to like
it.  Of course, we shall be meeting something
at Kempton&mdash;especially if Muscateer runs&mdash;but
whatever beats us will win, I think."
</p>

<p>
"It's good enough for <i>my</i> money," Scotty
announced, "an' if you take my advice you'll
'elp yourself properly w'en they begin bettin'."
</p>

<p>
Chris laughed as they left the box, and walked
into another.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you make it a point of honour to
back anything that runs from here," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly so bad as that, sir," the head
lad demurred, "but any'ow it's paid well up to
now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we've been pretty lucky," said Chris.
</p>

<p>
"Luckier than you was the first time I saw
you, sir," said the head lad significantly.  "You
was on yer back in the h'ambulance at Sandown
Pawk, and you wasn't 'arf 'outed,' neither.  I
was down at the fence where you 'came it'&mdash;I
always goes out into the course when they're
'lepping,' you know, sir," he explained.  "I like
to see what they're a-doin' of round the far side,
an' when the Stewards is at lunch, or 'arf-way
back to London before the last race is run.  I
see your 'orse fall&mdash;old Blow'ard it was, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Chris nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And when 'e went down, my last bob went
with 'im, but I didn't bear you no malice, sir, an'
I was the first man to get to you.  I've done a
bit o' riding in my time, an' I know all about 'ow
it feels to get knocked out, though, thank Gawd,
I never got such a 'biff' over the 'ead as that
'orse what was follerin' 'anded yer!"
</p>

<p>
Chris laughed, and passed his hand carefully
over a chestnut mare, which turned a vicious eye
upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Gently, gel, gently," walking up to her head.
"Pity she's so bad-tempered, isn't it, Scotty?"
</p>

<p>
"Turnin' sour, that's what <i>she</i> is, though when
she does take it into 'er 'ead to try, she wants
some catching, an' no error.  It's them sort as
gets innocent men warned off," Scotty concluded
bitterly, having a lively recollection of an
interview with the Stewards in connection with the
running of the mare, "though 'Eaving was
witness," as he told the Stewards, "that all parties
were innocent enough, except the jady mare."
</p>

<p>
Chris chuckled at the memory.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't forgotten your 'carpeting' yet, then,
Scotty?  It <i>was</i> bad luck.  I expected them to
send for me too, as the trainer.  I think I should
have asked one of 'em to ride the mare a few
times, to see how in and out she runs.  I've got
her in a Selling Hurdle at Wye next week, and
win or lose, she's to be sold&mdash;can't afford to keep
such a dangerous customer as that, can we,
Scotty?"
</p>

<p>
"We can <i>not</i>," the other agreed with feeling.
"A 'orse like that would break the Bank of
England, an' then win a nice race direc'ly you
sold 'er."
</p>

<p>
The two strolled round all the boxes&mdash;Chris
had eight horses in his charge now&mdash;and when
he had seen them all done up, went in to
breakfast, attended by his dogs, as usual.
</p>

<p>
No matter in what part of the house he might
be, or how long absent, his faithful escort of three
awaited him, eager, loving, full of warm welcome,
and if the fox-terrier, "Copper," were sometimes
jealous of his son "Penny's" accomplished tricks,
and Chris had occasionally to smack them both
into good behaviour, "Cypka," the bull-pup,
gave him no trouble whatever, acting, indeed, as
foster-mother to the other two, and occasional
peacemaker.
</p>

<p>
Chris's eye fell on a letter from Gay Lawless
among his correspondence, and his face brightened
as he opened it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Dear Chris," he read, "I shall be very glad
to see you any day for tea and a chat.  I've got
the Trotting mania badly, and though I know it
isn't much in your line, I <i>must</i> talk to somebody
about it, and dear old Frank is so difficult to
interest on any subject except science.  If you're
not racing anywhere, do come in to tea to-morrow
afternoon.  Lossie's coming, and I also expect
Mr. Mackrell, who thinks he has found a couple
of useful Trotters for me.  I am so anxious to
begin.&mdash;Yours sincerely,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"GAY LAWLESS."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Chris Hannen digested the news with mixed
feelings.  "Gay's mad on Trotting," he thought,
"and it's no sort of game for her.  Carlton
Mackrell has no business to help her, though, to
do him justice, after what he said the other day,
I can't accuse him of aiding and abetting exactly.
He is deadly in earnest about Gay, and he'll
have opportunities enough now, confound him!"
</p>

<p>
Yet Chris smiled as he folded her letter up, and
put it into his pocket&mdash;the breastpocket.  "All's
fair in love and&mdash;racing, I suppose, whether it's
jumping or Trotting."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Summers, Chris's housekeeper, came in
at that moment, and interrupted his thoughts,
which were somewhat interfering with his
breakfast.  She had occupied to Chris the same
position as Min Toplady did to Gay, but in
appearance was a direct contrast, for tall, angular,
and determined-looking, she inspired awe in all
save her familiars, who were few.
</p>

<p>
Her young master was the very apple of her
eye, and she strove to supply the dreadful want
in his life caused by the loss of his mother.  Just
she and two others knew how terribly he felt that
loss, for his mind was an open book to her, and
undemonstrative and practical as he invariably
was, he sometimes dropped a remark that showed
his thoughts were never far away from his
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"She was my pal," he said once to Gay, "the
only real pal I ever had.  I don't think we had
any secrets from each other&mdash;certainly no guilty
ones, thank God&mdash;and now she's gone, I realise
bitterly how much more I might have done to
make her happy.  She was easily pleased, bless
her, for all she wanted was to be with me, but
she never intruded, and I remember so well how
she used to propose something she thought would
please me, and say: 'If you don't mind, lovie?'
as though she thought that perhaps she bored me
sometimes."  Only Gay, and Mrs. Summers and
Aunt Lavinia knew the tremendous depth of feeling,
the capacity for suffering, that lay under Chris
Hannen's easy-going, bantering ways, and if the
housekeeper used all her tact and kindliness to
make up to him, if ever so little, something of
what he had lost, Gay Lawless, who had the
clearest possible insight into people's characters,
never made the mistake of volunteering any
sympathy.
</p>

<p>
She knew Chris hated it, as she did, and
appreciated his silent pluck as much as he did the
reserves of courage that had not yet been called
up in herself.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Master Chris," said Mrs. Summers
(he was always Master Chris to her,
never having grown up in her eyes), but her face
assumed a stern expression as she regarded the
only half-finished breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"No food again this morning?  I hope you're
not up to them wastin' tricks again?  Wastin'
your life, <i>I</i> call it," with a disgusted sniff.
</p>

<p>
Chris looked up with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Summers," he said.  "I hope
I see you well?  No, I am not wasting just at
present, though there's just a pound or two to
come off before Kempton next week.  We shall
have another glorious winner (Chris characterised
all winners as glorious) then.  Which is it to be
this time, a new bonnet or a dress-length?"
</p>

<p>
"Gloves this time, Master Chris, and thank
you," Mrs. Summers replied, "though there ain't
much chance of showing off any finery in <i>this</i>
place, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"How often has the butcher called this week,
Summers?" Chris asked, with a twinkle in his eye.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Summers tossed her head.  The butcher
was rather a sore point with her, his name having
been coupled with hers by "those impudent bits
of boys," as she designated the stable lads.
</p>

<p>
"If I hear one of them brats discussing me and
my affairs, I'll box his ears for him soundly," she
threatened, "so there!"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Summers, don't you stand it,"
Chris agreed.  "By the way, I'm going up to
town to-day, so don't bother about any dinner
for me."
</p>

<p>
He walked towards the door, then paused on
the threshold to fire a parting shot.  He loved
"chipping" people, as he called it, but he would
have cut off his right hand rather than wilfully
hurt anyone's feelings.
</p>

<p>
"If the butcher <i>does</i> call to-day by any chance,
Summers, there are no orders, you know," he
said with a grave face, then raced off into
his study before the enraged but complacent
housekeeper could reply.
</p>

<p>
"What a boy it is!" she said to herself as she
cleared away, "always laughin' and having a joke
about something, bless his heart!  I'm sure I'd
rather see him like that a thousand times, than
sitting so quiet as he does sometimes, looking
straight in front of him at nothing like, though <i>I</i>
know well enough what he sees, and who he's
thinking about, poor, lonely boy.  I wonder if
he'll ever marry that Miss Gay Lawless, whose
photograph he looks at so often?  If only she'll
make him half as happy as he deserves to be,"
she concluded, as she left the room with her
tray.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, that was the very question
that Chris was asking himself, as he stood in his
study gazing at Gay's photograph, though it was
not of his own happiness he was thinking at that
moment, but of hers&mdash;for that was Chris's way.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
TWO GIRLS
</h3>

<p>
Gay Lawless looked particularly bewitching the
while she entertained her visitors that afternoon.
She seemed more charming than usual to both
Chris and Carlton Mackrell, while even the
Professor, who usually noticed nothing, patted
her approvingly on the head, and remarked, "You
look very well, my dear."
</p>

<p>
Gay was gifted (for no one can acquire it) with
perfect taste in clothes, and her tea-gown was cut
with that attention to detail which results in
simplicity itself.  Although one could be with
Gay for quite a long time, and have the pleasing
assurance that she was the best style in the world,
there was always a great difficulty in remembering
exactly what she had worn.
</p>

<p>
"What had she on?" envious girls used to
ask the men who admired her, and the answer
usually was, "I don't know, but it was quite
simple, and <i>such</i> good style."
</p>

<p>
To-day she appeared to both men more lovable
than ever, and Chris thought what a shame it
would be to bury such a bright creature in a
place like Epsom, with no one to amuse or to
admire her except himself.
</p>

<p>
He took short hold of his fancy before it
carried him to further flights, however, as he
dropped into a chair by her side, while, much to
Carlton's disgust, the latter was button-holed by
the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"What's the latest about your Trotters?"
inquired Chris, breaking into a smile that
accentuated the crow's-feet round his young
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Great news," Gay replied with enthusiasm.
"Mr. Mackrell has bought me a couple he got
to hear of, a green Trotter who can go in about
2.18 called 'Silver Streak,' and a pacer with a
trial of 2.13¼ named 'Maudie T.'  And isn't it
kind of him, he's going to lend me his trainer&mdash;sounds
funny to talk of lending a man, doesn't
it?&mdash;while the craze lasts, as he calls it.  But you
know, Chris, it <i>isn't</i> a craze, it's a&mdash;a&mdash;almost a
disease now!  I'm racing one at Waterloo Park
next Monday, and oh! I do hope it will win, don't
you?" she asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart," Chris replied, with more
enthusiasm than he thought he could work up
over Trotting.  "And may I be there to see.
Monday, you said, didn't you?  That will suit
me to a T.  I've got nothing to do till Wednesday
at Kempton, so perhaps you'll return the
compliment, and come over to see me bump round on
Beeswing?  He did well in a gallop this
morning&mdash;better than I expected, in fact."
</p>

<p>
"Answered the question all right, did he?"
Gay asked.  "Does he represent a betting
chance on Wednesday, with the eminent
gentleman-jockey up&mdash;and is he <i>safe</i>?" she added,
turning a little pale.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's about as safe a jumper as an
amateur"&mdash;he grinned, "that's what some of the
professionals in their scorn for the 'leather-polishers'
they call us, could wish to ride, and
my head lad says he has so much in hand that he
could stop to scratch himself, and then win," Chris
chuckled.  "Oh! <i>hang</i> Lossie!"
</p>

<p>
The stifled ejaculation was prompted by the
entrance of a remarkably pretty girl, beautifully
dressed in dark blue, who rustled across the
room to Gay, and kissed her perfunctorily.
</p>

<p>
"<i>How</i> are you?" she inquired, but though
her voice was affectionate, her eyes flitted from
Gay to Carlton Mackrell&mdash;where they stayed.
</p>

<p>
"A1, Lossie, thanks.  I needn't ask how <i>you</i>
are.  I never saw you looking better&mdash;(or more
expensive)", she added to herself with a sigh, as
her cousin shook hands with Carlton and Chris,
and begged Gay to give her a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
Frank Lawless ambled forward, and was soon
busily juggling with milk and sugar basin, while
Chris wondered what in Heaven was wrong with
the girl, for if she always gave him the same
displeasing impression, he could not possibly
deny her beauty.  Tall and dark, with masses of
silky blue-black hair, she had eyes blue as heaven,
and straight, delicate features that emphasised the
irregularity of Gay's changing face, of which the
chief charm, perhaps, lay in its expression.
</p>

<p>
She seemed a bundle of nerves as her slender
foot beat a tatoo on the floor, while her wonderful
eyes were never still, yet never rested long on
any single object save Carlton, who was certainly
well worth looking at.
</p>

<p>
It was Lossie's misfortune to have fallen
genuinely in love with him, not for his money,
though she liked that well enough, but himself.
His was the Saxon temperament which veils the
keenest pleasure, and the deepest grief under the
same quiet, almost bored exterior, but she knew
that his indifference concealed an ardent, even
romantic temperament, that might be counted
upon sooner or later to betray him into one of
those follies so dear to the heart of woman, while
Chris's gay, almost affectionate manner to the
women he liked, argued a much greater warmth of
temperament than he really possessed.
</p>

<p>
She felt completely out of it as the three sat
talking horses, and had leisure to note the eager
look on Gay's face as she listened to what
Carlton was saying, also to digest the fact that
this Trotting fad would bring her cousin and
Mackrell more together than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Both your horses are timed to do two
minutes thirty seconds," said Mackrell presently,
"and upon that form they will be handicapped
on Monday.  I think&mdash;at least, 'Brusher' tells
me&mdash;that Silver Streak had improved on that time
in private, but he has always been 'just beaten'
lately, so they may put him on a few yards closer
mark next time he runs.  When a horse is entered
for a Trotting race, you know," he explained,
"the owner has to supply the handicappers with
his best time for a mile on a track."
</p>

<p>
"What's to stop a man representing his horse
as being able to do two minutes thirty seconds
when he knows he can do it in less?" inquired
Chris, for his experience of the Turf had made
him familiar with most of the dodges for throwing
dust in the handicappers' eyes, with a view to
getting dropped a few pounds in the scale.
"You can't get weight off in the stable," was a
dictum he often heard, but never practised.
</p>

<p>
"Well, for one thing," Mackrell replied, "the
officials generally like to see a horse do his time
before they frame their handicap, to prevent
mistakes, you know," and he laughed.  "For
another, if a horse improves appreciably on his
entered time, the 'man in the box,' as they call
him, wants to know something about it, though,
of course, a few seconds faster might be owing to
a good track and good going.  On the other
hand, if a horse does not trot up to his time, they
can, if they like, put up their official driver to
take him round as fast as he can make him go.
If the discrepancy is considerable, the scheming
owner will probably find himself suspended for
a few months, or even warned off."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Chris, who at heart deeply resented
Mackrell's encouraging Gay in her misguided
fancy, "when such men as Rensslaer and
Vancouver and that ilk, all hold aloof from the
sport as understood in England, what chance has
it of becoming a national sport?  The trotting
tracks here are so bad that it is really kinder not
to enumerate them; most are in connection with
public-houses, and the people who frequent them
are the middle class.  Trotting, in short, is the
sport of that and the lower classes, and they trot
cheap horses in consequence."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately," said Mackrell, with a slightly
heightened colour, for he got fearfully chaffed
among his own set for his bizarre taste, "the
upper classes take no interest in Trotting in
England.  It will take time to prove to them
that a trotter is not necessarily a butcher's horse,
but can vie with a hackney and swell carriage
horse, and is almost as fast as a motor car as
well, thus combining the horse and motor in one
animal.  Of course we all know that in America
the trotter is the National horse, as the
thoroughbred is the English one."
</p>

<p>
Chris was silent.  He thought that Mackrell
understood trotting, or rather mixed trotting
and pacing, as practised in England, but knew
nothing of the higher art of trotting, that is to
say, real first-class trotting with horses worth
money, and which could go in 2.8 or better&mdash;like
the famous Rensslaer's, for example.
</p>

<p>
"Are you <i>really</i> going to keep Trotters, Gay?"
Lossie cut in sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Rather! and I'm going to train at Flytton.
Inigo Court's close by, you know, and I shall love
seeing my horses jog in the morning.  They'll
let me do that, I suppose?" she asked Carlton
Mackrell, and pointedly turning her back on
Chris.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly," he replied, after a moment's
hesitation, and much to the disgust of the
Professor, who considered that all this horsey
talk was more suitable for stables than a
drawing-room.  He did hope Gay would not become
one of those horrid, slangy, racing-women he
abominated; almost unconsciously he exchanged
a glance with Lossie, who flashed back one of
sympathy, for jealousy and envy of Gay
corroded her.
</p>

<p>
All the advantages were with Gay&mdash;money,
position, freedom&mdash;there was even her great
capacity for winning hearts to set against her
cousin's beauty; it wasn't fair, and the unfairest
thing of all was Carlton Mackrell's obvious
devotion, and as Lossie sat unnoticed, while Gay
was the magnet that drew the eyes and hearts of
both men present, perhaps the two smartest and
best-looking men of their circle, and one of whom
Lossie loved, her gorge rose.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately Gay was not in love with him, and
up to now, at any rate, Carlton had not picked a
quarrel with Lossie for loving him unbidden, as
some men do (regarding it as an unwarrantable
encroachment on their liberty), and when Gay
married Chris, whom she loved without knowing
it, then Lossie would cut in, and a beautiful
woman at close quarters is a beautiful woman all
the world over.
</p>

<p>
Failing him, but the girl shuddered at the
thought, there was the Professor ... rich men
did not grow on every bush, and her tastes were
expensive.
</p>

<p>
The mother of Frank and Gay had been
wealthy, and their father and his family
comparatively poor, a fact greatly resented by Lossie,
who had a mordant tongue, and was wont to
describe the Lawless branch of the family as
"the silk cloak," and hers as "the cotton
lining."
</p>

<p>
It was with angry, embittered heart that later
in the afternoon she turned her steps homewards,
bitterly comparing her lot with Gay's, for Becky
Sharp's type is much commoner than is generally
supposed&mdash;the type that can be good and happy
(at a pinch) on five thousand a year, but <i>quite</i>
good, and <i>quite</i> happy on ten and upwards, and
Lossie was of that type.
</p>

<p>
She had friends, of course, and admirers, who
came to see her, George Conant much oftener
than she wanted him, but a house without plenty
of money, and a man at the head of it, is not half
equipped for life and happiness.  For the tiny
establishment in South Street was run, if not
ruled, by Aunt Lavinia (Chris's especial pal), who
would greatly have preferred the more roomy
comfort of Connaught Square, in which the
Professor and Gay buried their unfashionable
heads.
</p>

<p>
Both Lossie's parents were dead, and Lavinia
had given her sister's child a home, tackling
each day the difficult problem of trying to love
a singularly unloveable girl, though "Anyway, my
dear, she's delightful to look at!" Lavinia would
say confidentially to Gay, after some especially
flagrant piece of selfishness on Lossie's part.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia had a queer religion of her own (but
not so queer when you come to reflect that
nowadays real religion is found chiefly in those
who do not profess any), and it was summed up
in the love of humanity, and the law of human
kindness.
</p>

<p>
"Teach folks to love," she used to say;
"teach 'em to keep on loving&mdash;the rest will
follow.  No soul was ever yet damned that knew
how to love&mdash;it's in the loving, not the <i>being</i>
loved, that we find happiness.  Have you ever
noticed the courting couples about on Sundays
and holidays, that if the girls are not pretty, they
<i>look</i> so?  Love has done the trick&mdash;not new
clothes, or getting themselves up, but just <i>loving</i>
something that's not themselves."
</p>

<p>
Lossie had an immense contempt for the
"giving out" process of love as practised by
Aunt Lavinia, the more especially when it took
the form of cheques better employed in paying
the milliners' bills of her niece, nor was the
Professor more appreciative, for he seldom or
never went to see his father's sister in South
Street, though he welcomed her cordially enough
on her rare visits to Connaught Square.  Perhaps
it was because (as he had long ago suspected)
she reluctantly recognised him as lazy,
self-indulgent, ruined by his too abundant means,
amiable with the tepid amiability of a dog who
does not fight, and by blandishments hopes to be
allowed to retain his bone.  Hall-marked he was,
with the special form of selfishness that makes
the man completely happy in his bodily environment,
and mental pursuits and hobbies, shun the
society of his kind, and to whom it is a matter
of complete indifference that "grass-grown
become the paths to friendship that are never
trod."
</p>

<p>
He usually (in quite unconscious antagonism)
ordered twenty pounds worth of new books when
through Lossie he heard of some preposterously
good deed done by Lavinia, but to go and do
likewise simply never occurred to him, nor did
it at that time to Gay, who, without knowing it,
was selfish also.
</p>

<p>
Yet, but for this blessed privilege of youth,
where would beautiful, much-abused youth be?
Gay was young, full of life and spirits, and would
have to suffer a bit herself before she vividly
realised the sufferings of others, even if she
responded readily enough to any demand on
her purse, if not her time.  All of this Lavinia
perfectly understood, but much as she loved the
girl, Chris, whose mother's friend she had been
was the very light of her eyes.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
AT KEMPTON
</h3>

<p>
A bright, frosty morning broke for Kempton's
second day, and at Epsom, Chris Hannen
whistled and sang while he cold-tubbed and
dressed, in sheer light-heartedness born of the
pleasing conviction of training and riding another
winner before the day was out.  Besides, Gay was
coming to witness his triumph, and the prospect of
some hours in her society was enough to make any
man happy, he thought, while her "Never mind,
old chap; better luck next time," would considerably
soften the disappointment if he got beaten.
</p>

<p>
Having seen his horse started for the station,
he himself followed later on his way to town to
pick up Gay.  That young lady was as cheerful
as Chris as she went about the house fixing
things up, and arranging for her brother's comfort
during her absence.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't get into mischief, Heron," she
had told him at breakfast.  "I shall be back
soon after five, and I'll tell you all about how
Chris gets on.  I <i>know</i> you'll be interested to
hear, won't you?" she added teasingly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope he will get on&mdash;and stop on," the
Professor replied, with as near an approach to a
joke as he ever permitted himself.  "I like Chris
Hannen," he went on, regarding his sister over
the rim of his glasses, "and I wish he would give
up that dangerous game before it gives <i>him</i> up
You have some influence with him, Gay; can
you not exercise it?"
</p>

<p>
The light suddenly went out of her face; then
she shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Every man to his own game, Heron, and
Chris is as devoted to 'chasing as you are to
science, you dear old fossil!"
</p>

<p>
"Hum!" was all the Professor vouchsafed to
this remark, for to compare <i>his</i> pursuit with that
of Chris was nothing short of an insult.
</p>

<p>
When Chris arrived about eleven o'clock he
found Gay ready and waiting for him, dressed in
a smart, workman-like tweed coat and skirt, and
with her glasses slung.  A remarkably
good-looking and happy pair they looked as they
drove to meet the coach that Effie's husband,
Captain Bulteel, a sporting man&mdash;and who among
Gay's friends was not sporting, except Lossie
Holden?&mdash;was driving down to Kempton Park races.
</p>

<p>
A place had been found for Chris, and when
they arrived at the rendezvous in Eaton Square
they were received with great warmth, Gay
especially, and were soon on their way.
</p>

<p>
Effie and Gay talked nineteen to the dozen,
and the drive was very pleasant.  Though not
the coaching season, Tom Bulteel was no
believer in his team standing idle during the
winter, so drove them to all the suburban
meetings, or to Richmond, and other places,
when there was no racing within reach.  Everyone
was in the best of spirits, and expressed
surprise when the coach turned on to the course&mdash;the
all-absorbing topic of horses having claimed
the party's attention on the way, it was little
wonder that the journey seemed no sooner to
commence than it was over.
</p>

<p>
Naturally everyone had asked Chris about
each and every race on the card.
</p>

<p>
"I never give tips," laughed Chris.  "If they
come off, people grumble at the price or
something&mdash;as though I could help that&mdash;and if they
don't, they look aggrieved, and more than half
suspect one of putting them away.  But I'll tell
you this much&mdash;I'm having my maximum of a
'pony' on, and I expect to get it back, plus
adequate interest, you know."
</p>

<p>
Arrived on the course, they made their way to
the paddock to find Beeswing.  He was in his
box, and showed no signs of the railway journey.
The lad opened the door as they approached,
touching his cap to Gay, and regarding her with
the unabashed admiration peculiar to his class.
</p>

<p>
"All right?" Chris inquired, walking up to
the horse and patting him, an example Gay
instantly followed.  "Good.  My bag's in the
dressing-room, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  I see Captain Conant's traps there
too.  'E's come to try and ride that 'orse of
Gunn's, I s'pose."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he always rides for that stable," Chris
replied, and smiled.  He had a way of summing
up people; "drops her h's and calls it h'arsthma,"
was his definition of a rich, vulgar old woman he
and Gay detested, and "a pair of spurs and a
grin," had as aptly hit off Captain Conant, who
fancied he could ride, and courted public disaster
on every possible occasion.  He was also an
ardent but at present infrequent worshipper at
Lossie's shrine, as, greatly to his disgust, his
regiment was now quartered in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
"Pity Lossie's not here, eh, Gay?" whispered
Chris in an aside.  "Let's go and have some lunch&mdash;that
is, <i>you</i> can have some, while I will sit and
watch you longingly, and dream of my next meat
dinner!"
</p>

<p>
They returned to the coach for lunch, and
Chris looked after Gay with the same care and
attention that a trained nurse bestows on a patient
whose will she has reason to think has been
made in her favour, and the girl enjoyed herself
thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Captain Conant was to ride in the first race,
and her remarks on his ability as a jockey, and
his probable fate, would have quite unnerved the
gentleman in question could he have heard them.
</p>

<p>
"There he goes!" she exclaimed as a man
cantered past, "<i>what</i> a seat!  Did you ever see
anything like it?"
</p>

<p>
Chris smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> ugly, isn't it?" he agreed, "but men
ride in all shapes, you know, and it isn't always
the best-looking in the saddle that is the
strongest."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, thank you," Gay replied saucily,
"but George Conant can't ride for nuts, and
never will.  I wonder he hasn't broken his neck
long ago.  Of course, he only rides the safest of
jumpers, and even so, it's no odds on his not
jumping first.  You yourself told me, Chris," she
added reproachfully, "that he often throws down
his reins at the fences, and catches hold fore and
aft, shrieking loudly if anything ranges alongside!"
</p>

<p>
Chris exploded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes," he said, "he's certainly not what
one would call a bold horseman.  He likes to
have most of the course to himself, and regards
it as a liberty if anyone approaches within two
lengths of him.  He once reported a jockey who
had the temerity to shout 'Yah!' while they
were both in the air over a fence, and in
consequence of which remark he lost his balance&mdash;he
has no grip, you know&mdash;and fell off."
</p>

<p>
"Frightened Isaac!" cried Gay indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," continued Chris, "he described the
ejaculation as an intimidating one, and was
surprised that the Stewards did not immediately
suspend the perpetrator from riding again.  The
next time the two met in a race, the professional
did not confine his ejaculation to the fences, but
kept up a running commentary upon poor George,
while his remarks were rather more pungent than
on the previous occasion.  I have before now
helped George back into the saddle over the
'drop' fences&mdash;chiefly by the slack of his
breeches, you know&mdash;and he seemed surprised,
not to say grateful, that I had not given him the
gentle push that would have dissolved the
precarious partnership between himself and his
horse."
</p>

<p>
"Has he ever won anything?" Gay asked, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  This year he has won two races,
one a walk-over for a National Hunt flat race,
and the other when there were three runners.
One was not trying, and ran out after going
half-way, while the jockey of the other was so beat
two fences from home, that he lost his senses, and
fell off on the flat.  George did not notice this,
and for the last quarter of a mile rode a desperate
finish, mistaking the jeers of the crowd for
appreciation."
</p>

<p>
"Bet you a pair of gloves he comes undone
this time, falls barred," Gay said, and Chris
closed, knowing it was a bad bet for him, but
welcoming the prospect of buying gloves for
Gay, and perhaps being permitted to button
them up.  What felicity!
</p>

<p>
Gay's glasses were turned to the starting-post.
</p>

<p>
"He can't get his horse to join the others,"
she announced.  "He's speaking to the starter&mdash;who
looks annoyed, from his attitude.  I do
believe there are tears in his eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Strong glasses yours, Gay, aren't they?"
inquired Mrs. Bulteel mischievously, but Gay
was too busy to heed her.
</p>

<p>
"They're running," she said the next moment.
"George has got away all right, and the pace is
good.  Something in green&mdash;what is it, Chris?&mdash;is
alongside him; oh-h!&mdash;that was a near thing.
He all but came unglued, as you call it, at that
first fence.  He's got back again now, and is
picking up his reins.  Does he <i>always</i> drop them
when 'in the air'?  Now they're coming to the
ditch, and, by the way he's riding, I think I win
my bet here.  Sit back, <i>sit</i> back, man!" she
muttered, as George rose to the fence, and on
landing was shot far up his horse's neck, whence
he gradually pushed himself back into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bulteel laughed right out; it was more
interesting to watch Gay than the race.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! one's down&mdash;blue and white chevrons!"
Gay glanced at her card to see its name.  "It's
'Topaz.'  The jock's up all right, but Topaz is
where he fell&mdash;winded, I expect.  Where are the
others?" sweeping the field with her glasses.
"Oh, there they are, and Captain Conant's still
on top."
</p>

<p>
The horses were running towards them now,
and every incident of the race could be seen
without glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Knight Errant's going best," Chris said.
"By Jove, can't he jump!  Just through the top of
the fence where the 'give' is!"
</p>

<p>
The horses galloped past, and Gay put up her
glasses as they rounded the bend into the back
stretch.
</p>

<p>
"Two more down," she said, "and at the plain
fence too!  It's a bit on the angle, isn't it, Chris?"
</p>

<p>
He did not reply.  He was watching the three
remaining runners approach the water with a
quiet smile.
</p>

<p>
"You'll win your gloves there if anywhere,
Gay," he said.  "George never did like the water."
</p>

<p>
The words were scarcely out of his mouth
before the expected happened.  George's horse
galloped strongly up to the guard fence, dwelt for
a second, and then gave a tremendous bound
which carried him clear over the water.  The
impetus was evidently too much for his rider, who
abandoned his reins, and incidentally his whip
too, at the very moment his mount took off.
</p>

<p>
With a shriek of despair (which Gay declared
she heard quite plainly), he described a parabola
in the air, and descended in a heap in the middle
of the water.  His horse galloped on with the
other two&mdash;it was not the first time his owner had
parted company with him without apparent
reason&mdash;and he showed his sense of the situation by
lobbing along behind the others, thoroughly
enjoying himself.
</p>

<p>
George remained in the water till he thought
they had all gone over.  He had no intention of
being jumped on if he could help it, and he had
sense enough to lie where he fell (and he fell
pretty often), knowing that a horse coming behind
cannot dodge you, if you are trying to dodge <i>him</i>.
Then Lossie's admirer crawled out, a dripping,
miserable-looking object, and made his way
towards the paddock.
</p>

<p>
Passing close to the coach, Chris called out
to him, "Not hurt, are you, George?"  The
reply was indistinct, though Gay supplied one.
</p>

<p>
"Hurt?  Of course not!" she said, chuckling;
"only badly frightened!  And anyway, I've won
my gloves!"
</p>

<p>
Soon after, Chris went over to change, and Gay
was all impatience for his race to begin.
</p>

<p>
"You'll see something worth looking at," she
informed the others.  "Whenever I see Chris
ride I think there's nothing like Steeplechasing,
and whenever I see Mr. Mackrell drive, I think
nothing can touch Trotting.  I really believe I
prefer Trotting, though, for it hasn't the danger
of this game, and I don't like to see anyone I'm
fond&mdash;anyone I know&mdash;run such risks."
</p>

<p>
"After all," said Effie, "it's a gentleman's
sport, and if the dear boy <i>will</i> break his neck at
it, he must.  But as to your Trotting mania,
Gay," hurriedly changing the conversation as Gay
whitened, "frankly, I don't think it's good enough
for you, and Carlton ought to be ashamed of
himself for infecting you with his taste for it."
</p>

<p>
"He didn't," retorted Gay.  "I maintain that
a perfect Trotter is every bit as pretty a sight as
a horse racing&mdash;and not half so dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!" said Effie, a shade of anxiety on
her small, weather-beaten face, "take care you
don't get drawn in too far, and talked about&mdash;it's
unusual, you know, a girl going in for that
sort of thing, and not quite nice.  Pity you can't
hand Mackrell over to Lossie&mdash;the Trotting
Meetings would be good enough for her&mdash;they're
not for you.  Frankly, I think the Professor for
once is quite right <i>there</i>."
</p>

<p>
But Gay was not listening, she was just asking
herself whether she really were fond of Chris, and
<i>how</i> fond, when that gentleman cantered by with
a cheerful nod, her opinion of him in the saddle
being amply justified.
</p>

<p>
His lithe, graceful figure was seen to its best
advantage in colours, while his long legs seemed
riveted to his horse's sides&mdash;leaning slightly
forward, and standing in his stirrups, he and his
mount were in the most perfect unison, and
personified the very poetry of motion.
</p>

<p>
"He'll take a lot of beating," one of the men
on the coach prophesied.  "He never says much
about his horses, but I know he's very sweet on
his chance to-day.  I'm going into the Ring to
back him," he added to Gay.  "Can I do
anything for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Put half-a-sovereign on for me, please," Gay
replied, producing the coin, "and see if you can't
get over the odds, whatever they are; say it's for
a lady," she laughed, and the man lingered a
moment to look at her bright face&mdash;yes, there
was no doubt about it, all the men liked Gay.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the horses were off.  There
were eight runners, and a lightly-weighted one
cut out the work at a strong pace.  They strung
out a bit over the first few fences, with the
favourite Musketeer always nicely placed, and
Chris on Beeswing lying handy.
</p>

<p>
Gay watched the race keenly, describing all the
running to Mrs. Bulteel, who noted that most of
her remarks concerned Chris.
</p>

<p>
"Watch him now," she exhorted.  "Up!
Well over!  That's the way to ride over fences.
Chris calls it the gentle art of sitting back.  He
says you <i>can't</i> sit back too far."
</p>

<p>
As the horses passed them she called out,
"Well done, Chris!  Well done!" in girlish
delight.  She looked her very best just then, the
cold air heightening her colour, her grey eyes
almost black with excitement and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
A fall occurred at the fence before the water,
but the rest got safely over, and Musketeer began
to improve his position little by little.  He was
ridden by a jockey who had steered two Grand
National winners, and Chris knew too much of
the skill of the man to let him get too far ahead
if he could help it, so he too sharpened up a bit.
As they approached the last fence he saw he had
only the favourite to beat, and from the way his
own horse was going, he felt he had his measure.
</p>

<p>
They rose together, and for a few strides ran
side by side, Chris going easily, while the other
was "niggling" with his hands.  Chris improved
his position, calling out "Good-bye, Arthur!"
having no desire to be caught "napping" by
such a consummate artist at finishing as his
opponent.  He drew away with a length's lead,
and in a flash out came the whip on the favourite,
who responded gamely, and for a stride or two
(or so it seemed to anxious Gay) looked like
catching Chris.
</p>

<p>
But to even a poor judge of racing it was all
over.  Chris had a lot in hand, and galloped
home an easy three-lengths winner, the jockey
on the favourite ceasing to persevere when he saw
it was hopeless.  He was a fine horseman, and a
merciful man, a combination by no means common.
</p>

<p>
"After all," said Gay, with a rapturous sigh,
"I'm not sure that I would not rather see Chris
win a race, than take the Gold Vase with one
of my Trotters!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not do both, my dear?" said Effie dryly,
"so long as you don't take Carlton Mackrell as
well."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE ESCAPADE
</h3>

<p>
Acting on Carlton's advice, Gay did not enter
her horses for Blackpool, Glasgow, Liverpool,
Belfast, or Leeds; the Irish Meetings were of
course out of the question with so small a stable,
so that she was practically limited to three
Meetings within easy reach of town.
</p>

<p>
"It was," as he privately expressed it to
himself, "merely a flirtation with Trotting, not
playing the game itself," and he hoped that like
other ill-advised flirtations, it would die a natural
death.  Though he honestly believed that Trotting
had a future in England if properly managed, he
had most unwillingly come to the conclusion that
Chris was right, and though it furnished a healthy
amusement for a great number of cheery, happy
people, under existing conditions it was decidedly
neither his, nor any young girl's <i>milieu</i>.
</p>

<p>
No doubts whatever troubled Gay, who was
thoroughly enjoying herself, and two days
before the meeting at Waterloo Park, at which
Silver Streak was to carry her colours for the first
time in public, she succeeded in effecting what
she had set her heart on, viz., the driving by
herself at exercise of one of her horses.
</p>

<p>
With her usual incorrigible frankness she
unfolded her plan to the Professor at luncheon,
much to his horror and disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Can you not be content to be a spectator,"
he asked, "instead of participating actively in a
sport (he pronounced the word with venom)
which Lossie tells me claims as its closest
adherents publicans and tradesmen?  A nice
thing it would be to find your butcher or
fishmonger careering round the course beside you,
encouraging you with shouts and cries such as are
practised on all race-courses, or so I am informed,
for I have never visited one.  I deeply deplore
this unhappy infatuation, but, as usual, my wishes
are ignored," he concluded huffily.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a prig, Heron," said Gay carelessly.
"You can't help being a muff, I suppose, or
Lossie a sneak, but for father's sake&mdash;and a
better sportsman never breathed, as you know
well enough&mdash;<i>do</i> try to take a little interest in
sport, even if you refuse to participate, as you
elegantly express it.  To hear you talk, one
would think you were employed by the
Anti-Everything-Healthy-League, and that you had
a special mission to fulfil in saving everybody's
soul&mdash;at the expense of his body, of course!  It's
enough to make the poor old dad turn in his
grave to hear you go on as you do.  If he
were alive, he'd be the very first to back me up."
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the clock, and jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"Time and trains wait for no man," she said.
"Run off to your laboratory, old chap, but before
you go, give me a kiss&mdash;and your blessing."
</p>

<p>
She stood up on tip-toe to meet the Professor's
chaste salute, imprinted somewhere in
the neighbourhood of her ear.
</p>

<p>
"Expect me when you see me," she said
maliciously as she made for the door, "and
don't be surprised if I return in pads.  There's
sometimes an accident at Trotting, you know."
</p>

<p>
The Professor ambled towards her, shaking
his head apprehensively, but Gay was half-way
upstairs.  She had only just time to catch her
train, and would get down to Inigo Court by
half-past three, with time enough to give the
horses their work out round the track.
</p>

<p>
Tugwood had promised to borrow a speed
wagon of a different pattern for her to drive in,
for her disregard of public opinion did not go to
the length of perching on a seat the size of a
soup plate, with her legs stuck out on either
side of the horse, which was the usual mode of
progression.
</p>

<p>
On the journey down, she read the <i>Trotting
World</i>, a journal devoted to the interests of
the sport, and was delighted to find a paragraph
about herself and Trotters in it.
</p>

<p>
"If a few more people of Miss Lawless' and
Mr. Carlton Mackrell's class and position could
be induced to patronise Trotting," she read,
"the sport would soon assume its proper
standing, and become, as in America, a national
pastime."
</p>

<p>
Gay walked briskly along the country road
leading to Inigo Court, and made her way to the
stables.  There she found Tugwood in Silver
Streak's box, the horse already harnessed, and
ready to be put to the wagon.
</p>

<p>
"Horses all right, Tugwood?" Gay asked,
pulling on her driving gloves&mdash;thick
bus-driver's gloves they were, bought on Carlton
Mackrell's recommendation.
</p>

<p>
"Never better, miss, thank'ee.  Silver Streak
don't want too much work to-day, with 'is
race so near, an' 'e's pretty fit.  I 'ad 'im out
early this mornin', just to work off any stiffness
'e might 'ave after a good spin against the
watch yesterday.  A mile easy at 'arf-speed, at
a three-minute gait, is about all 'e wants now."
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I shall be able to steady him," she
said.  "He does 'take hold' a bit sometimes,
doesn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"On'y when 'e's racin', miss.  'E don't like to
see nothin' in front of 'im.  I expect you'll be
surprised at the pace 'e goes, an' think 'e's
runnin' away.  But 'e ain't really, you know," he
added reassuringly; "'is manners is too good to
bolt with anybody, let alone a lady."
</p>

<p>
He chuckled at his joke as he helped Gay into
the wagon, which was a boat-shaped Benjamin,
weighing 46 lbs., the body much like the seat of
an outrigger boat, with rounded ends to break
the wind.
</p>

<p>
She made a very pretty picture as she sat in
the wagon, excitement and the bloom of health
showing in her face.  As Tugwood led the horse
on to the track, in accordance with instructions,
she slipped her wrists through the loops in the
reins, and planted her feet firmly against the
foot-rests.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be nervous, miss," Tugwood urged.
"Just keep a nice steady hold on 'im, an' keep in
the middle of the track.  Time enough to think
of cuttin' the corners when you know more about it."
</p>

<p>
Gay had no intention of cutting the corners,
and devoutly hoped that Silver Streak had none
either, as Tugwood stepped to one side.
</p>

<p>
"Jog him, miss," he said, "and gradually let
'im out."
</p>

<p>
Gay did as she was told.  Silver Streak "got
into his stride" with a suddenness that was a
little disconcerting, ready as she thought she was
for it, and the wagon shot forward, while her
arms felt as though they were being pulled from
their sockets.
</p>

<p>
Shifting her position as soon as she had
recovered her balance, she hung on to the reins
like grim death, and steered for the middle of the
track, as Silver Streak was evincing a partiality
for the rails that spelled probable disaster at the
bend, unable as she was to balance him properly.
</p>

<p>
The horse stretched himself out to his work in
grand style, and before they had rounded the first
turn, Gay felt convinced he was running away.
The pace was tremendous, while the wind
whistled past her ears and made her face smart
with its force.  She took a pull at the horse after
the way she had seen drivers do when pulling up
after a "brush," before a race started, but at once
felt the uselessness of it, and was not surprised
when Silver Streak pulled back, though his pull
was of considerably greater strength than hers,
and resulted in another temporary loss of balance,
this time nearly over the dash-board.
</p>

<p>
The horse's hind feet were much too close to
be pleasant, and she earnestly hoped he would
not cast a shoe, which, for a certainty, must fly
into her face, or so it seemed.  Along the back
stretch she cast a glance in Tugwood's direction,
half expecting to see him brandishing his arms,
or covering his eyes to avoid seeing her untimely
end, but no such view met her gaze.  On the
contrary, he was leaning over the rails in an
attitude that betokened an easy mind, and as she
turned her head, he clapped his hands repeatedly,
thus conveying to her the reassuring news that
she was doing well.
</p>

<p>
She negotiated the home-bend nicely, though
by this time her arms had begun to ache in
earnest, and her breathing was not so regular
and easy as on foot.  Now her natural fears had
subsided, she felt that she was having the time of
her life, and disregarding her trainer's instructions,
actually encouraged Silver Streak to go faster.
This the horse did, and made the pace a cracker
on the second circuit, though even then he was
by no means going his fastest.
</p>

<p>
Approaching the spot where Tugwood was
holding up his hand as a signal to stop, she took
another pull at Silver Streak, but with as little
result as before.  Another pull, but with a like
effect&mdash;the horse was evidently enjoying himself,
and intended to complete another circuit.  Gay's
horrified look as she sped past, sitting back as
far as she could, and hauling at the reins, brought
a smile to Tugwood's face.
</p>

<p>
"Finds it ain't quite so easy as it looks," he
said to himself, though with no anxiety, but as
the wagon bore towards him again, he opened
the gate leading to the stables, and walked down
the track with outstretched arms to meet it.
</p>

<p>
Silver Streak saw him, and pricked his ears, at
the same time slowing down till he dropped into
a walk almost on the top of his trainer.  Gay
heaved a little sigh of relief as they turned off
the track.  She was quite numbed with the cold,
and her feet felt like lumps of lead, while her
hands shook violently from the strain, as she
disengaged them from the reins, and jumped to
the ground.
</p>

<p>
"That was ripping!" she said, stamping her feet.
</p>

<p>
Her voice sounded catchy, which was not to
be wondered at after so much excitement,
crammed into such a short time.
</p>

<p>
"I hope the extra lap won't hurt him, Tugwood?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it, miss.  Why, 'e wasn't goin'
fast enough to keep 'imself warm at any time.
You didn't do the first mile in much under three
minutes, I'll be bound."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Gay, "I've never travelled so
fast before in my life, behind a horse, anyhow.
I wonder what the excitement of a race must be
like?"
</p>

<p>
A mad idea to dress up as a man, and drive at
the next Meeting flashed across her mind, but she
dismissed it as altogether impracticable.  Besides,
it had been done before&mdash;in books, anyway&mdash;and
Gay was nothing if not original.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow do you like drivin', miss?" Tugwood
inquired, as he led Silver Streak back to his box.
</p>

<p>
"It's splendid!" Gay replied enthusiastically,
"but it <i>does</i> make your arms ache, doesn't it?
Mine feel all on fire now."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that always 'appens to a beginner," the
trainer explained indulgently.  "You'll get the
better o' that after a few more turns, and learn to
take a nice steady hold, just to feel his mouth,
instead of hanging on like grim death.  I suppose
you won't drive Maudie to-night, miss?  It's
rather late, an' just on doin'-up time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well, I won't, then," the girl
answered, "but you must not think I am afraid,
you know, because I'm not."
</p>

<p>
"No fear o' that from one of <i>your</i> stock, miss.
I've heard tell of your father, an' a better plucked
'un with 'osses never lived.  I'm always to be
found here, miss, so if you'll drop me a line
any time you want a drive, I'll be waitin' for you."
</p>

<p>
With the promise of a speedy return, Gay took
her departure, quite unaware that there had been
an interested spectator of her work on the track,
in the person of Mr. Rensslaer, who by accident
was passing.  He occasionally used the track in
private for trying a horse when too far from his
own place, and happening to look over the
hoarding which enclosed the course, had seen
Gay driving Silver Streak in his wagon, of
which Tugwood had begged the loan.
</p>

<p>
The sight had greatly amused him, and as she
passed, he ducked his head, afraid of "scaring"
the girl, for he saw at a glance that she was a
complete novice at the game, though he
expressed himself emphatically and aloud on her
performance.
</p>

<p>
"Now, that's what I call real sporting," he
exclaimed, standing up in his wagon to get a
better view, though even then his head barely
reached the top of the hoarding.
</p>

<p>
"Wonder who she is?" he soliloquised.  "I'll
go in, and inquire of Tugwood when she's finished
her work out.  Mighty pretty girl, anyway,
though she don't look altogether as if she's
enjoying herself.  That's a nice pure-gaited
one she's driving&mdash;for England."
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of the spin, and after Gay
had left the place, Rensslaer continued his drive,
turning in at the park gates, then made his way
round to the stables, where Brusher Tugwood,
hearing the approach of hoofs, left Silver Streak's
box, and came out into the yard to see who it was.
</p>

<p>
His grim old face relaxed into a respectful
smile, and he pulled at his cap as the new-comer
sprang out of his road wagon, looped up his
reins, and adjusted a horse-cloth with the quick
dexterity of the professional.
</p>

<p>
Tugwood waited for developments, looking
inquiringly at the powerful, straight-hipped horse
in the wagon, and Rensslaer was quick to follow
his glance.
</p>

<p>
"That's old 'Marvel Girl,'" he volunteered,
and gave her pedigree; then immediately, keen
enthusiasts both, they fell to talking and
comparing notes of doings on both sides of the
Atlantic, Rensslaer walking Tugwood restlessly
up and down, the idea of his original quest quite
vanishing from his mind.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he said, suddenly remembering
it, as he drew the "cooler" off his waiting horse
and folded it up, "who is that young lady I saw
going round the track a while ago in my wagon?"
</p>

<p>
"That was my young mistress, Miss Gay
Lawless, sir, and very kind it was of you to
humour her with the loan of that wagon; she
couldn't have done what she was so dead set on
else.  It was 'er first drive, though where you
see it from, I don't know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So that was Miss Lawless, was it?"
Rensslaer said thoughtfully.  "I've heard the
name only just lately.  There was something
in the <i>Trotting World</i> about her, and some
horses she had bought.  It is a surprise to me
to find a lady patronising Trotting."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Tugwood, not desiring to typify
his mistress as the example that proved the rule,
"I shouldn't wonder if before long we don't 'ave
a duchess trottin' 'orses under our Rules, the
same as they do under the Jockey Club," but his
tone lacked conviction.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know Mr. Carlton Mackrell,
then," pursued Rensslaer, who himself did, and
foresaw through him an introduction to Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Know 'im, sir?  I should think I did indeed,"
the trainer assured him.  "Why, it was me as
introduced Mr. Mackrell to Trottin'," and he
drew himself up proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Been fairly successful too, hasn't he?"
Rensslaer inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Remarkably so, sir, I'm pleased to say,"
said Tugwood, bridling, "though I says it as
shouldn't, seein' as 'ow I've 'ad the trainin' of his
'osses till quite lately.  I left Mr. Mackrell to
come to Miss Lawless, you see, sir, an' I 'ope to
be as successful for 'er as I was for 'im, though
of course Miss Gay 'as only just started, so to
speak.  I expect to 'ave a winner for 'er at the
next meetin' 'ere, sir&mdash;that 'oss you see goin'
roun' just now.  Silver Streak 'is name is.
Come an' 'ave a look over 'im."
</p>

<p>
Together they entered the horse's box, where
Tugwood proceeded to recount Silver Streak's
performances before he came into his charge.
</p>

<p>
"A nice horse," commented Rensslaer,
"though I should call him too good-looking.
Quite a picture compared to my mare outside,
isn't he?" indicating with a jerk of his head the
rough-and-ready-looking animal in the wagon.
Certainly Silver Streak was more of the race-horse
stamp than the trotter, and the expert shook
his head as he looked him over from all points.
</p>

<p>
"Not a record-breaker, I think," he opined,
"and what is his best time?"
</p>

<p>
"Two-twenty on this track, sir," the trainer
said, "though I think I can improve 'im a lot on
that time.  In fact, Miss Gay thinks of enterin'
'im for the Champion Vase, an' though I won't
go so far as to say he'll win it, some of the others
will know they've been racin' before they're done.
There's some good 'osses with form be'ind 'em
waitin' with a view to that race.  Demonstrator's
one of 'em, an' Mr. Mackrell's Billy Q., wot won
at the last meetin' 'ere, is not out of it by a long
way.  From what I know of that 'oss&mdash;an' I
trained 'im for all 'is races&mdash;'e'll very near win
it.  Whatever beats 'im will win any'ow," he
concluded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall see," replied Rensslaer.  "I
must be off now, but you'll see me again before
long.  What did you say Mr. Mackrell's present
address was?"
</p>

<p>
Tugwood did not remember having mentioned
it, but he replied:
</p>

<p>
"The Bachelors' Club will find 'im, sir, though
I shouldn't wonder if 'e don't 'ave to resign there
afore long from wot I can see of it," he added to
himself, but Rensslaer heard him as he climbed
into his wagon and drove off.
</p>

<p>
Tugwood, left alone, shook his head gloomily.
His late visitor's low estimate of English horses
annoyed him by its assurance; he also resented
the slur Rensslaer cast on the sport by abstaining
from it in England, while practising it in most of
the big capitals of Europe.  A fine sportsman,
with one of the finest, if not <i>the</i> finest, stable of
Trotters in the world, he was the very man to
elevate and establish the sport firmly here, and it
was with a sense of depression that Tugwood
gave Silver Streak his evening feed, and remained
to watch the horse eating it up.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
GAY TRIUMPHANT
</h3>

<p>
In a spirit of pure mischief Gay had invited
Lossie Holden to accompany her and Chris
Hannen to see Silver Streak's début, and they
drove the short distance from the station to
Waterloo Park in excellent spirits, Gay all
impatience to see her horse trot, and Chris as
interested as he could ever be in anything outside
his own stable.
</p>

<p>
Lossie was entirely out of sympathy with Gay's
natural excitement; all sporting tastes were low,
she considered, and Trotting quite the lowest of
them all.  She could not understand a woman
possessing the healthy, out-door instinct&mdash;a
girl's first duty, she considered, was to herself,
and her time was much better employed in
making herself as attractive as possible in the
eyes of men, than in sharing their rude pursuits.
Man was woman's lawful spoil, and for her part
she quite understood why the "manly woman"
remained a spinster, and by not attracting, failed
in her mission in life.
</p>

<p>
In this, as in other matters, Lossie's view was
too narrow to be correct, for she could not
separate Gay, with her healthy love for horses,
and dogs, and an open-air life, from the muscular,
loud-voiced, corsetless Amazons who are so
frequently much better athletes than men, and
well able to protect the lady-like creatures in
breeches they usually marry.
</p>

<p>
Chris noticed the contrast between the two
girls especially that day, Gay, looking the picture
of health, and thoroughly alive in her plain tweed
frock, her workman-like gloves, and stout boots,
intent on a good day's sport, and exulting in the
part she was to play, and Lossie, "dressed to
kill," with her bored, petulant air, tilting her
nose (a very pretty nose, too, Chris had to
admit), whenever a fly-load of "mellow"
Trotting men galloped past.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the course, Chris obtained a
race-card that they were busy discussing, when a
hearty voice called out at Gay's elbow:
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Miss Gay?  Well, I <i>am</i> glad
to see you again."
</p>

<p>
Gay turned to see Min Toplady, and while she
took in the opulent splendours of her attire, with
a delighted side-glance she caught the disgusted
look on her cousin's face.
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Min!" she cried, embracing her
old friend heartily, then with a quick, mischievous
glance at Chris, she dragged the somewhat
flustered Min up to where stood Lossie Holden,
a supreme figure of elegant disdain.  "Why,
Lossie, surely you've not forgotten Min Toplady,
my dear old nurse," cried Gay.  "All my friends
are Min's friends, aren't they, Chris?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he replied, with difficulty keeping
his countenance, so tickled was he by Lossie's,
then raising Min's tightly-gloved hand to his
lips, respectfully kissed it.  "Min and I are
old pals, and I really think she's beginning to
quite approve of me at last?" he added with
twinkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll do, Mr. Chris," Min said, laughing,
"until you break your neck with your silly
jumping."  She was very quick, and knew that
the young man's instant ranging of himself on
her side was due to Lossie's frigid acknowledgment
of her presence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Miss Gay," said Min reproachfully,
"I've been expecting you to look me up at
the 'Trotting Nag,' Camberwell&mdash;I always tell
Bob it was the name of our 'pub' that started us
at the Trotting game&mdash;but you'll be more than
welcome when you <i>do</i> find time."
</p>

<p>
Gay promised eagerly that she would come
soon, and Carlton Mackrell appearing at that
moment, they split up into groups, he remaining
with Lossie Holden, who regarded with horror
the progress of the others to Min's wagonette,
where, with exaggerated gusto, Gay assisted
Chris to partake of sherry and sandwiches.
</p>

<p>
"She don't alter much," said Min, glancing
at the distant Lossie, now exercising all her
fascinations on Carlton, but when Gay with her
usual generosity urged that Lossie did not have
much of a time, Min interrupted her majestically.
</p>

<p>
"Don't make no excuses for her, Miss Gay;
what she always was as a mite she is now.  I've
got her weighed up to an ounce, my dear, and if
she's a <i>real</i> friend of yours, and not a spiteful,
jealous cat, I've made a mistake, and I don't
make many among my own sex, if I <i>did</i> make a
bloomer when I took up with my old man&mdash;"  And
she beamed upon the enormous and delighted
Bob, who had just come up, and acknowledged
the soft impeachment with a prodigious smile.
</p>

<p>
"There goes the bell for the horses to get on
the track for the first heat; let's go into the
enclosure, and watch the 'plugs' go round," cried
Gay, and off she and Chris went together, Gay
running back for a moment to give Min a "tip."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mackrell thinks my horse will win his
heat and the final&mdash;Brusher Tugwood drives,
and he knows the horse.  He's very sweet on
his chance.  Mind you back ours, Min dear, and
tell your friends to 'help themselves,' as they say."
</p>

<p>
The first heat over, Gay and Chris went off to
the stables, Carlton Mackrell and Lossie joining
them.  Mackrell studied his card as they went
along.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure to win your heat," he said,
"and the time of your horse, and the other two
heat winners, will tell us what chance you have
in the final, but according to the conditions of the
race, I think it's a good thing for you."
</p>

<p>
Chris smiled.  He had seen too many "good
things" come undone, though in this case there
were no fences in the way, he reflected.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the stables in time to watch
Brusher Tugwood put the finishing touches to
Silver Streak's toe weights.  The horse looked
splendid, and Gay's brand new colours&mdash;blue and
white hoops&mdash;showed up brilliantly in the wintry
sun.
</p>

<p>
Gay walked beside her driver while he led the
horse to the track gates.
</p>

<p>
"This <i>is</i> a good thing, isn't it, Tugwood?" she
inquired anxiously.  "I do so want to win the
first time out, you know, though I oughtn't to
expect it," she added.
</p>

<p>
"We shall win all right, miss," Tugwood
assured her.  "Do you pop into the ring and
back me as if money&mdash;or price&mdash;was no object."  He
climbed into his perch, and turned on to the
track, where he let Silver Streak stride along at
about half-speed.
</p>

<p>
By the time Gay and the others had got back
to the stand, the second bell had rung, and the
horses were jockeying on their marks for a start.
Gay had invested, through Carlton Mackrell, a
couple of pounds on her horse for the driver,
Tugwood, and the odds of four to one were
obtained.
</p>

<p>
She would not bet herself.  "I don't approve
of regular betting," she said; "besides, I shall
get five pounds if I win this heat, and fifty pounds,
actually fifty golden sovereigns"&mdash;she clapped her
hands and laughed as if she had never seen so
much money before&mdash;"if Silver Streak wins the
final as well!"
</p>

<p>
Bang went the pistol, and the horses were off.
</p>

<p>
"You've won it now," Carlton Mackrell said
quietly, his eyes showing his appreciation of the
consummate skill of Tugwood in getting off like
lightning, and almost in his stride.
</p>

<p>
Though they had to go three rounds for
the mile and a half, the value of a good
beginning was soon made obvious as Silver
Streak swooped down on the horses in front of
him approaching the first bend.  Along the back
stretch he improved to third place, and though
the leader was thirty yards and more to the good
there, Carlton Mackrell knew that Silver Streak's
driver was only biding his time, and would win
comfortably, without distressing his horse with a
view to the final.
</p>

<p>
"I do believe he will win!" Gay cried
breathlessly, as the horses passed the stand, the
same one leading, while Silver Streak and a
pacing mare called Mrs. Wiggs were racing side
by side.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it," Carlton Mackrell assured
her.  "Let me congratulate you."
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed rather nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said, "but not yet.  Oh,
look, there's something&mdash;Mrs. Wiggs, isn't
it?&mdash;that's passing Silver Streak now.  Why doesn't
Tugwood go after her?"
</p>

<p>
The apparent catastrophe occurred on the
back stretch approaching the turn.  Chris, looking
on, noticed it, and prayed that Mrs. Wiggs
could not sustain the effort.  He saw, too, that
the pair had considerably decreased the leader's
advantage.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," Carlton Mackrell declared.
"Tugwood will make his effort&mdash;an easy one,
too&mdash;directly they get into the third lap."
</p>

<p>
And so it proved.  Mrs. Wiggs' advantage
was only temporary, and directly Tugwood asked
Silver Streak to catch the leader, he did so in
decided fashion, and Gay breathed a sigh of joy
and relief as Tugwood put the issue beyond
doubt fifty yards from the box, and jogged in, a
two-lengths winner, in 3.36 from scratch.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I'm so glad!" Gay exclaimed, and
indeed she looked radiant, and altogether
adorable, as she received from the two men
congratulations so warm that Lossie's silence
was quite overlooked.
</p>

<p>
The beauty was quite out of her element, and
took no pains to hide the fact.  How Gay <i>could</i>
mix with such awful people she did not
understand, and she registered a vow that this was
the first and last visit she would pay to
Waterloo Park, or any other of the Trotting
Meetings.
</p>

<p>
It was adding insult to injury, too, for Gay
to openly show her friendship with that vulgar
person, Min Toplady.  She looked angrily in
the direction of the carriages, where the "vulgar
person's" purple gown refused to be overlooked,
and Min was clearly in <i>her</i> element as she dispensed
hospitality with a lavish hand, while Bob conducted
an earnest conversation with a professional
driver.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Lossie?" Gay inquired
suddenly.  "I'm afraid you're not enjoying
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Chris and Carlton Mackrell exchanged glances,
both prepared for the same reply.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not," she said positively.  "What
you can see in this rabble, and travesty of sport
I'm sure <i>I</i> don't know&mdash;I mean," suddenly
remembering, and turning a dazzle of blue eyes
and smiles upon Carlton Mackrell, "from a
woman's point of view, of course.  I quite
understand the fascination driving your own
horses has for you, Mr. Mackrell, but I can't
admit that it's quite a nice thing for a girl&mdash;"  But
she spoke to unheeding ears, for he had divined
Gay's wish that he should take her to the stables,
and when he suggested it, she went with him
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Lossie and the unwilling Chris
together, they made their way through the Ring,
Mackrell drawing ten pounds from his bookmaker,
who begged him "not to do it again."  Her
original stake of two pounds Gay put in her
pocket, tightly clutching the remainder in her
little fist.
</p>

<p>
They found Tugwood assisting a lad to rub
Silver Streak down, and highly pleased with
himself.  He magnificently waved Gay's outstretched
hand containing the eight pounds away.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it all down, miss, please," he said;
"put the lot on our 'oss for the final.  We shall
win outright now, for the best field was behind
me in the first heat.  You understand the
market 'ere, sir, don't you?" he asked Carlton
Mackrell, "so don't forget to distribute the money
among the bookies.  A quid 'ere, an' a couple
there, you know, sir, though you won't get such
a nice price again.  It's wonderful 'ow they pinch
the price for a heat winner for the final."
</p>

<p>
Together Gay and Carlton watched the next
four heats, Gay taking particular interest,
naturally, in the heats which concerned her race,
and when the horses turned out for the eventful
final, Carlton Mackrell walked down the rails to
speak to Tugwood, for he had seen something in
the second heat that he knew would be valuable
knowledge to the driver, and this he told him.
He had barely time to get back to the stand
before the bell rang to announce the start.  But
Silver Streak did not get off so well this time,
and for the first circuit of the course only
improved two places.  Passing the stands he was
fourth, the heat winners and two fastest losers
being qualified to go in the final, and Gay's
expressive face looked the picture of despair as
the horses sped past to the turn.
</p>

<p>
"He'll never catch the leaders," she exclaimed;
"they're all going well, faster than they went
in their heats, it seems to me.  Whatever does
Tugwood keep looking round at that crimson
jacket behind him for?  I don't see any sense in
it; it's those in front he has to beat, not that one."
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell laughed.
</p>

<p>
"He's doing what I told him," he answered.
"The crimson jacket is the real danger.  Look!"
</p>

<p>
As if to prove his words, the pacer mentioned
suddenly increased his speed in a great effort to
pass Silver Streak.  Tugwood instantly responded,
and a great race for supremacy began between
the pair.  The terrific speed they were going at,
took them past first one leader and then another,
while from the enthusiasm among the spectators
on the stands, it was apparent that they regarded
the race as a match between Silver Streak and
the crimson jacket.
</p>

<p>
Rounding the home bend into the straight in
the last lap, there were still three in it&mdash;the trotter
which had led throughout, Silver Streak, and the
pertinacious crimson jacket.  Each driver was
doing all he knew, but Tugwood had the inside
position, which he kept with a bit to spare, thus
compelling the other two to go wide at the turn,
and Carlton Mackrell and Chris both appreciated
his fine and legitimate driving.
</p>

<p>
A great race ensued up the straight, all
three horses' names being shouted in turn, each
exhorted by their respective backers to "go on."
</p>

<p>
Amid a storm of cheers and encouragement
the three flashed past the box, but Carlton
Mackrell, from his intimate knowledge, knew
that the one, two, Tugwood had given Silver
Streak a few yards short of the judge, had done
the trick, and snatched a bare victory.
</p>

<p>
Gay was trembling with excitement, while
even Lossie sufficiently forgot herself to stand
on tiptoe to watch the number board.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," Carlton Mackrell announced.
"He's putting No. 3 in the frame, and that's
yours.  Won by a neck, I should say, all out,
in 3.32½."
</p>

<p>
Gay heaved a deep sigh, and then they all went
on to the track, and, after Tugwood had
dismounted, accompanied Silver Streak in a body
to the stables.
</p>

<p>
The crowd gave Gay a hearty cheer as she
passed the Ring, and this completed her cup of
bliss.  Min Toplady showered congratulations
on her, and was so pleased that she actually
smiled at Lossie, hastily composing her face the
moment she realised the mistake.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
AT THE "TROTTING NAG"
</h3>

<p>
It was by deliberate intention, not accident, that
Lossie found the Professor alone on the day
following Silver Streak's victory, and conveyed
to his mind her own epicurean disgust at the
associations to which Gay's new Trotting mania
had exposed her, though jealousy at the increased
opportunities of her cousin for meeting Carlton,
was really at the bottom of her interference.
Lightly, but maliciously, she ran over the whole
scene, the surroundings at Waterloo Park, so
utterly different to those of an ordinary race
meeting, and, so far as she could see, without a
gentlewoman present save Gay and herself.  But
when, in speaking of the "public-house ladies"
present, she mentioned Min Toplady, the
Professor visibly stiffened.
</p>

<p>
"A most estimable woman," he said, "and
nurse to all the younger members of our family.
She adored Gay, and though we lost sight of
her on her marriage, I don't know anyone from
whom my sister would take better a word in
season than Minnie.  I am shocked to hear that
the poor woman has taken to racing&mdash;married a
sporting publican, I fear."
</p>

<p>
Lossie shrugged her graceful shoulders as her
appraising glance ran up and down the Professor's
handsome, if unbraced, figure and face, then
round the pictures and appointments of the room
in which they sat.  After all, she might do worse,
if&mdash;if&mdash;but Gay was not going to have it all her
own way with Carlton Mackrell.  Chris Hannen
was <i>her</i> man, and the sooner she realised it the
better.
</p>

<p>
"I have a great mind to go and see Minnie,"
said Frank nervously, "and get her to use her
influence with Gay&mdash;but I don't know her
address&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Lossie, with curling lip, "<i>I</i> can
tell you&mdash;the "Trotting Nag," Camberwell, which
is precisely the place and neighbourhood where,
from her appearance, you might expect to find
her!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, now," protested the Professor, for
unkindness is not so much a matter of speech as
of atmosphere, and he thought it unbecoming that
so lovely a creature as Lossie should be so
acrimonious.
</p>

<p>
And yet he pitied her, without parents, without
money, though why she had not married long
ago, and brilliantly, was a puzzle to more worldly
people than the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Frank," she said, "I'm afraid you'll
find her much more Gay's ally in the matter
than yours.  Why don't you put your foot down
<i>yourself</i>, and insist on Gay's giving up this
disreputable business?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor sighed, and Lossie longed to
shake him.  Fearing that she might be tempted
to do so, she got up to go, and she was so tall,
and at that moment so beautiful in her contempt,
that an unwonted thrill ran through him.  After
all, he was only a man, and not such a very old
one at that, and reading him perfectly, she put up
her face to his, and murmuring, "Dear old
Frank!" kissed him with rather more than
cousinly warmth in farewell.
</p>

<p>
He stood looking at the door through which
she had passed with what Gay called his "gay
old dog" air of reminiscence; then his thoughts
reverted to Minnie, and her good influence over
Gay when the latter had been a wilful, charming
child, and on the spur of the moment he decided
to go and see her.
</p>

<p>
It was lucky that Gay was out.  It would never
do for her to intercept him, and inquire where he
was going, for he had a wholesome dread of his
sister's discerning eye.
</p>

<p>
Upon such occasions as he invented "taradiddles"
to cover more or less unlawful excursions
abroad, he was invariably bowled out, and stood
disconsolate, and looking justly sheepish at the
emphatic "Rubbish!" with which they were received.
</p>

<p>
"You're a bad liar, Frank," Gay said one day,
"and wouldn't deceive a child.  But why lie at
all?  Besides, your memory isn't good enough."
</p>

<p>
Now he hailed a hansom, and darting into it as
quickly as a rabbit into its burrow, through the
trap-door gave as his destination, the "Trotting
Nag," Camberwell, looking, moreover, so guilty
and self-conscious, that the cabby smiled broadly
as he gathered up the reins, and chirruped to
his horse.
</p>

<p>
"Looks more like the British Museum than a
'pub,'" he said to himself, "but, Lord, appearances
is such liars!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor squeezed himself into a corner
of the cab, and tried to marshal his ideas and line
of attack.  He did not relish his job, as he had a
lively recollection of Min Toplady's temper years
ago, before she was married; he hoped that
matrimony had softened her downrightness
considerably, and also that her husband would be
there.  He felt he could count on his sympathy,
if not on his support, because men always hang
together where a woman is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the long drive he talked nervously
to himself, and attracted much attention by his
silent rhetoric and expressive gestures.  His
Jehu passed the wink to such other Jehus as
congratulated him on his fare, and having peeped
through the roof in the middle of one of the
Professor's most impassioned appeals, reassured
interested curb-loungers by tapping his head
significantly, and turning his eyes heavenwards.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the "Trotting Nag," the Professor
was most reluctant to leave the security of the
cab, and merely met the cabman's reminder that
he had arrived at his destination, with an "Ah,
yes; so I observe."
</p>

<p>
Finally collecting the fare from the depths of a
waistcoat pocket, he thrust it hurriedly through
the roof, and hastily descended.  Without looking
ahead, he made for the door of the public bar,
entering with a run, and cannoning violently
against a navvy coming out, who had consumed
sufficient beer to become severely critical of the
manners of other people.
</p>

<p>
This individual, having recovered his balance
against the door-post, promptly inquired "where
the 'ell the old image was agoin' to?"  But the
Professor had sought the far end of the bar, and
was inquiring nervously, and with many smiles,
if Mrs. Toplady could be seen.
</p>

<p>
A good-looking barmaid regarded him with
speculation in her eye, then remarked:
</p>

<p>
"I think she is in.  Is it about the gas?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor assured her it was not, but
quite a private matter, upon which the barmaid
withdrew, and a moment later Min Toplady
herself emerged, and gave an exclamation of
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul!  Why, it's Master Frank!"
</p>

<p>
The remark attracted some attention in the
bar, one of the customers remarking that the
Professor was "a bit old-fashioned" for a kid, as
Min raised the flap of the bar, and escorted her
guest through it to the parlour, where a few
privileged friends had the right of entrée.
</p>

<p>
It was empty now, the harassed Professor was
relieved to find, and as he stood before the fire,
and looked anxiously through the door into the
bar, Min's hospitable mind mistook his meaning.
</p>

<p>
"What will you be pleased to take, Master
Frank?" she inquired, and the Professor looked
at her blandly as his fingers flitted lightly round
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Take?" he repeated.  "Oh, nothing, I thank
you.  I seldom indulge, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must have something, sir, if
only for the good of the house, as some of the
boys say who have had more than is good for
them already, just on closing time," she insisted.
</p>

<p>
The Professor thought of his errand, and in
the exuberant presence of Min, felt his courage
slipping away from him.  Perhaps a little drop
of something might revive him, he thought&mdash;a
little "jumping powder," as those sporting friends
of Gay's would call it.
</p>

<p>
But Min had already disappeared into the bar,
and quickly returned, bearing a small glass.
</p>

<p>
"Being such a cold day, a drop of milk punch
won't do you no harm, sir," she said, putting
the glass down before the Professor.  "It's a
wonderful thing for warming the cockles of your
heart, and it always does my indigestion&mdash;to
which I'm a martyr&mdash;a power of good."
</p>

<p>
The Professor could trace no direct connection
between the cockles of his heart and
Min's indigestion, but nevertheless he took the
proffered drink gratefully, and sipped it with the
air of a connoisseur, while Min sat down, and
racked her brains to find a reason for his visit.
</p>

<p>
A silence ensued.  The Professor was
temporising, but by the time his glass was empty,
he felt a little more able to open the ball.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you wonder why I am here?" he
suggested, standing on one leg, and looking more
like a heron than ever.  "The truth is, I&mdash;er,
wish to speak to you about my
sister's&mdash;er&mdash;infatuation&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For Mr. Chris?" exclaimed Min, though
all her sympathies were really with Carlton
Mackrell and his Trotting proclivities.  "Well,
Master Frank, a good son makes a good husband
all the world over&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am glad to say she has so far not
committed <i>that</i> folly," said the Professor, "at
least to my knowledge."
</p>

<p>
Min snorted.  What did this fossil know
about love, indeed, that he should speak so
slightingly of it?  The idea!
</p>

<p>
"Infatuation for what, then?" she inquired.
"Come, Master Frank, out with it, and let's
hear the worst, though I'm sure it can't be
anything very bad where Miss Gay's concerned."
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked hopelessly around.  Why
did not Mr. Toplady come in, he wondered?  Men
are so much easier to tackle than women, and
Min was always so brusque and business-like.
</p>

<p>
"My sister's infatuation (there's no other word
that meets the case), is for a form of sport that
I am given to understand is patronised by people
who have an even lower moral standard than the
followers of horse-racing.  I refer to Trotting."
</p>

<p>
Min Toplady bridled visibly, strong supporters
as she and her husband were of the sport he
decried, and she began to see how the land lay.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sure!" she exclaimed.  "You've
got no business to speak like that about what
you don't understand.  You'll excuse me, Master
Frank, but you don't know what you're talking
about.  Me and my 'usband goes Trotting
whenever we can get away, and we don't consider
ourselves as dishonourable and low, as you seem
to think Trotting folk are, not by no manner of
means&mdash;"  In obedience to a gesture from her, the
barmaid appeared with a second glass of punch,
deftly removed the empty one from behind the
Professor's back, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The Professor turned nervously round, and
was agreeably surprised to find a full glass
awaiting his attention.  Surely he had finished
the first?  He supposed not, however, and really,
after that tirade, he felt the need of a little
comfort.  He raised the glass, and looked through
it to the window.
</p>

<p>
"I did not mean to hurt your feelings, Minnie,
far from it.  I fear I am unfortunate in expressing
myself.  I mean that people are talking about
my sister associating herself with a sport"&mdash;he
hesitated for a moment as though swallowing a
bitter pill&mdash;"that as yet has failed to attract
people of her own class."
</p>

<p>
Had Mrs. Toplady been a snob, here was
another remark to form a bone of contention.
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose you think it's all my fault, then, sir?"
she asked, watching the Professor delicately
sipping his punch.  "I told Miss Gay at Inigo
Court it wasn't quite the thing for her, though I
saw no reason why she shouldn't go in for it if
she chose.  Trotting's all right, take it from me,
Master Frank&mdash;it's the sayings of a lot of
outsiders who don't know their book" (the Professor
blinked, and regarded his glass fixedly) "that gives
it a bad name.  Me and Bob's been at it a few
years now, and we've done a goodish bit of
horseracing in our time too, and always with the
half-crown public, so to speak.  But I give you my
word, I'd sooner be among the Trotting lads than
the proper racing crowd."
</p>

<p>
"Might I inquire why?" said the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Well taken all round, they are a sight
straighter than most of the mobs who go racing
in silk hats and frock coats, and don't you forget
it, Master Frank.  I've had a good many things
sneaked in a race-course crowd, but I've never
had my bag snatched at Trotting, and never
expect to.  There's a freemasonry among them
low people" (the Professor winced and changed
his legs) "that won't let 'em interfere with you,
even as a stranger on the track.  There's bad
hats among them, of course, but somehow the
fact that a man's coming Trotting is a guarantee
among 'em that he's all right, and unless he
<i>arsks</i> for it, he'll be let alone, even if dressed
in bank-notes.  They <i>may</i> be all little men,
butchers, fishmongers, and publicans&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She sniffed audibly, and the Professor squirmed;
nevertheless, things had begun to look more rosy
to his view.  That second glass of punch had
produced an elation of feeling which he had been
entirely without on his arrival, and now, as he put
down his empty glass with elaborate precision,
and squared his shoulders, there was decision in
his tone, if a momentary loss of balance of his
person as he said:
</p>

<p>
"I am firm in my resolve, nevertheless, to put
a stop to my sister's utter disregard of the
conventionalities."
</p>

<p>
His voice sounded unfamiliar in his own ears;
he found extraordinary difficulty in separating
the words that all ran into one another.  Things
would be easier, he thought, if only his listener
would sit still, and not rock about in her chair so
ridiculously.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what you want to interfere for,
Master Frank," said Min, checking a smile,
"though for the matter of that, I don't s'pose
Miss Gay attaches much importance to it.
Haven't you ever thought how lonely her life
is?" she broke out, remembering their talk at
Inigo Court.  "She hasn't got very much to
amuse her, and&mdash;you'll excuse a bit of plain
speaking&mdash;I'm afraid you're not much of a
comfort to her.  She don't complain, bless her
plucky heart, but it ain't natural for a young girl
like her to be cooped up in London with no
companion of her own age&mdash;for Mrs. Bulteel is
nearly ten years older, and 'most always with her
husband, and Miss Lossie&mdash;well, she don't count.
'Twould be small blame to her if she took up
with things&mdash;<i>and</i> people&mdash;a deal worse than
Trotting folks."
</p>

<p>
The Professor resumed an erect position.
This view had never been brought home to him
before; his own selfish life, absorbed in science
to the exclusion of all else, so contented him,
that never a thought had entered his mind about
his duty to Gay.  She seemed happy enough
always, he reflected, and because she never asked for
anything, he supposed she had nothing to ask for.
</p>

<p>
Min saw her advantage, and pursued it.
</p>

<p>
"It would serve you right if Miss Gay was to
marry, and leave you to look after yourself," she
said severely.  "I'm sure it's not for want of
chances.  There's more than one, or two even,
young gentlemen as is head over heels in love
with her now, and either of them could give her
more fun and sunshine than she ever had with
you, Master Frank!"
</p>

<p>
Frank Lawless thought of the girlish glee of
the telegram he received on the day of Silver
Streak's victory, "Won my first race&mdash;Hooray!"
and how he had not only failed to congratulate her,
but lectured her at dinner.  He looked so crushed
and miserable that Min's kind heart relented;
there were tears in his weak blue eyes, though
whether induced by self-reproach, or born of the
unaccustomed punch, Min was not prepared to say.
</p>

<p>
Now she crossed over to him, and laid a kind,
motherly hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Don't take on about it, Master Frank," she
said; "perhaps I've rubbed it in a bit too strong.
But if my advice is worth anything, you won't try
to deprive the child of the bit of harmless fun her
horses will give her, but thank your lucky stars
that she's content to stay at home, and look after
you, instead of gallivanting about all over the
shop, like some folks, trying to get someone to
marry them!"
</p>

<p>
She sniffed disgustedly, meaning Lossie, whom
she suspected, and rightly, of setting Frank
against Gay's new fancy.
</p>

<p>
"As for what people say, let 'em.  Them as
don't like it can lump it&mdash;don't you worry&mdash;or
worry dear little Miss Gay."
</p>

<p>
The Professor felt a burning desire to lay his
head down on Min's ample bosom, and weep
bitterly; he had not expected to be tackled so
vigorously, though he had known he would not
have things all his own way.
</p>

<p>
"Buck up, Master Frank," Min encouraged
him, "and have another drop of punch before
you go home.  Your heart's in the right place&mdash;at
least it always was when I had the looking
after the boys and Miss Gay, and you only want
just telling what to do, which is to let well alone."
</p>

<p>
The Professor accepted the punch (in a smaller
glass this time) and drained it at a gulp, though it
was insidious stuff, he feared, and treacherous.
Dreading further criticisms of himself, he seized
his hat, and grasping Min's hand, worked it like
a pump handle, then started for the door with a
little run, breathing a sigh of relief when he
reached the pavement.  Fortunately, whatever
his head might be, his legs were of cast-iron, and
he slipped nimbly enough into a hansom, just
managing to jerk out his address to the cabby,
before he fell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
The stopping of the cab woke him, and
hurriedly paying the man double his fare, he
admitted himself with his latch-key, and
proceeded on tiptoe to his study to finish his
interrupted nap, taking the precaution to first
lock the door.  There was more of wily Brer
Rabbit in the Professor's composition than most
people supposed.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE NOTORIOUS GAY
</h3>

<p>
Gay and the Professor were sitting at luncheon,
the girl still highly delighted with her recent
success, and laughing as she described Lossie
Holden's disgust at Min Toplady.
</p>

<p>
"She called her low, Frank, fancy that!  Dear
old Min, who was always so good to us, and
never said an unkind word.  You remember her
well enough, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor agreed that he did, though he
felt that his recent interview with the lady in
question did not justify him in amplifying his
sister's description of her amiability.
</p>

<p>
He fidgeted nervously with his letters (mostly
circulars), then ran his knife down the wrapper
of a newspaper which lay by his plate.
</p>

<p>
"Why have they sent me this, I wonder?" he
said.  He had not long to wait for an answer to
his question, for upon smoothing out the paper,
his attention was instantly attracted to the front
page.
</p>

<p>
The next moment, with a startled exclamation,
he hurled the paper from him, pushed back his
chair, and walked to the window, rather to Gay's
astonishment, though he always became "light-headed,"
as she called it, when anything but the
obviously expected happened.
</p>

<p>
She snatched the paper up, and the next
minute broke into a ripple of laughter.  What
she saw was a full-page illustration of the Trotting
at Waterloo Park, Silver Streak winning, and
inset at one corner a remarkably life-like snapshot
of herself, in close conversation with "Brusher"
Tugwood.
</p>

<p>
Below was some letterpress giving her name,
and describing her as a new recruit to the sport,
with one or two personal compliments with which
she could easily have dispensed.  The snapshot
was deeply blue-pencilled round, while in the
margin appeared a big note of interrogation,
evidently ironic.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it <i>good</i>!  How flattering!" she said
provokingly, though her thoughts flew to Chris,
and how annoyed he would be.
</p>

<p>
Her brother did not reply.  His pride&mdash;or
what did duty for it&mdash;was mortally hurt.  To
think that his sister&mdash;the sister of Frank Lawless,
F.R.C.S., F.R.S., etc.&mdash;should be exploited in a
public print like any opera-bouffe girl&mdash;it was too
much!
</p>

<p>
"They'll call you 'the <i>Trotting</i> Girl!'" he
squealed.
</p>

<p>
"Most women waddle," said Gay flippantly,
"and if my action is one-half as good as some
Pacers I have seen, I am quite satisfied.  But are
you sure it was addressed to you, Frank?" and
Gay looked at the wrapper to try to identify the
handwriting, but found no clue there.
</p>

<p>
"Some justly indignant friend of yours&mdash;or
mine&mdash;has seen this rag"&mdash;he spoke bitterly, and
without turning to face her&mdash;"and sent it on with
a commentary that speaks volumes for their
opinion of your taste.  I hope you are pleased
with your&mdash;notoriety."
</p>

<p>
"I am," Gay replied emphatically&mdash;"delighted,
and I hope it will give a leg-up to a real good
sport, though I don't flatter myself that my
connection with it will boom it much.  What is
there to be annoyed about?" she went on.
"Surely there's nothing so very disgraceful in
being snapshotted?  I assure you I didn't pose
for the photo."
</p>

<p>
She thought it absurd that he should take the
thing so seriously, and not in the least see its
sporting side, and now looked at the paper again
with a provoking laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I think you ought to be proud of such a
pretty sister," she said pertly, "instead of
standing there grizzling, and trying to belittle my
sporting tendencies.  I'm awfully amused at it.
Perhaps, in the course of time, I may aspire to
the dignity of the Sporting and Dramatic, who
knows?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor did not reply, though his wrath
was abating.  Min's suggestion that his sister
might be driven to seek companionship and
recreation away from him had sunk into his
mind, and though he could not bring himself to
encourage, or even tolerate, her deplorable taste
in sport, he was nevertheless wide-awake enough
now to the possibilities of existence without her.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be helped, I suppose, my dear," he
said at last, "but it is to be regretted.  Were it
not for the degrading influences&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk nonsense, Frank!" Gay interrupted.
"You don't call Mr. Mackrell degraded, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, my dear.  I find him singularly
refined for an&mdash;er&mdash;a sporting-man."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! when <i>will</i> you learn the difference
between a sportsman and a sporting-man,
Heron?" Gay asked piteously.
</p>

<p>
The Professor declined to prophesy.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," she said, "Mr. Mackrell is
coming to tea this afternoon, and has asked
permission to bring Mr. Rensslaer with him.
He's the great driver and owner of Trotters,
you know&mdash;I daresay you've often seen his name
in the papers&mdash;they say his stable contains the
pick of the horses of the world&mdash;but, of course,
you haven't," she added, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"This place is becoming quite a sporting
rendezvous," said Frank spitefully.  "I hope, at
any rate, you will have the decency to exclude
reporters from your meetings."
</p>

<p>
Gay stamped her foot.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be absurd, Frank," she cried with
spirit.  "None of my friends interfere with you,
and you needn't shed the gloom of your depressing
countenance on the scene if you don't want
to.  I expect Lossie as well, and I've no doubt
she'd much prefer talking science (ahem!) with
you, to listening to us talking horses."
</p>

<p>
"I appreciate Lossie's attitude towards sport
as thoroughly as I deplore yours," he said with
unexpected energy.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, then," Gay replied cheerfully.
"You two ought to make a match of it.  Why
don't you?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor actually blushed, and to cover
his confusion, ambled away towards his laboratory,
while Gay puzzled over that blue pencil mark of
interrogation, in vain.
</p>

<p>
Later in the afternoon, as she sat in the
drawing-room awaiting the arrival of her visitors,
she looked very different to the little tomboy
who so lately had driven her horse round the
racing track.  Dressed as usual in white, and
almost buried in the depths of a saddle-backed
chair drawn up close to the fire, it seemed
impossible to associate her with the keen
sportswoman, who openly declared that she would walk
ten miles to see a steeplechase or a trotting race,
and who rode and drove equally well.
</p>

<p>
Or so, indeed, thought Rensslaer, as he followed
Carlton Mackrell into the room&mdash;possibly his
expression showed a little of the surprise he felt,
for Gay laughed as they were introduced.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the women on your side don't do
such outrageous things as own Trotters, do
they?" she said demurely, as Rensslaer shook
her hand heartily.
</p>

<p>
"I always admire a straight 'sport,' man or
woman," he said, looking into Gay's grey eyes,
"and I am proud to meet you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she replied simply.  "Do sit
down, and tell us all about Trotting in America.
I had no idea until lately that you were so keen
on it over there."
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer blinked with those brown eyes of
his, that looked so kind above the big, nondescript
nose, and brown moustache just streaked with
grey.  He was so used to being taken for an
American who had made a speciality of owning
and driving fast Trotters, that he seldom took the
trouble to explain how he had never set foot in
the United States, was born in St. Petersburg,
had a French mother, and that to cultivate Trotters
was only one of his many pursuits.
</p>

<p>
"Well, in America a man takes it as a personal
reproach if another man passes him on the road
with a horse," he said.  "Trotting there is
brought to a fine art, and apart from track
racing, there is keen competition in Trotting
races, called 'Matinée Races,' that take place
with gentlemen drivers, much as polo is played
at the London Clubs of Hurlingham and
Ranelagh.  In fact, it is considered a distinction
to own and drive a fast trotter in America,
Austria, and Russia, instead of a man being
rather ashamed of it as in England, where, if you
want something fast and showy, you prefer a
hackney."
</p>

<p>
Carlton shook his head&mdash;he honestly thought a
trotting horse or pacer going at full speed a far
prettier sight, as did Gay, and they both said so.
</p>

<p>
"Ever since the big association agreed to a
code of rules a few years back," went on
Rensslaer, "it has become <i>the</i> sport of America.
Yes, it's curious," he went on reflectively, "that
England, considered to be the most horse-loving
country in the world, has never cared for
Trotters, that while in Russia the Orloff Trotter
is considered fit for the Emperor to drive, and in
the United States, the President, in England he
is always looked on as a butcher's horse, and quite
unfit to be seen in aristocratic society."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Carlton, "as I believe about
three million pounds worth of prizes are trotted
for each year, it is no wonder the Trotter is
popular in America."
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed, so did Rensslaer.  When he
laughed, he screwed up his face till his eyes
were invisible, and Gay found him deliciously
quaint.
</p>

<p>
"But they play the game, Miss Lawless," he
said.  "In all countries, except England, there
have been ruling bodies over Trotting which
safeguarded the sport, but in England, till lately,
everyone could do as he liked, with what results
may be easily imagined.  Consequently Trotting
has got a bad name, and people fight shy of a
sport which does not rank any higher than prize,
cock, and dog fighting."
</p>

<p>
"But we're improving," exclaimed Carlton.
"The last few years very strong endeavours
have been made to purify the sport in England,
and several Trotting Clubs have sprung up which
impose heavy penalties and expulsion on anyone
not acting in a strictly honourable manner."
</p>

<p>
"So I have heard," said Rensslaer drily,
"but it will be a hard task, as so many horses
have been imported from America, then raced
under false names in England, and it is often
impossible to trace the original names of such
horses.  In short, there will never have been
any classes on this side for real American trotters,
until they are introduced at an International
Horse Show here that we hope to arrange.  In
all the so-called trotting races in England, they
let pacers start, and the public doesn't know the
difference.  They say in consequence that the
American trotter is no good, that he only
shuffles."
</p>

<p>
"You are hard on pacers," said Carlton drily.
"Well, a pacer of say 2.15 speed is very
much less valuable than a trotter of the same
speed, so it is cheaper to get pacers than
trotters, and anyone having a really fast trotter
has the mortification of being beaten by a cheap
second-rate pacer."
</p>

<p>
"The fastest trotting breed of all is the
American, of course?" said Gay, eager to glean
all she could about what interested her so keenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the Russian Orloff used to be at least
some twenty seconds slower, but now, with an
admixture of American blood, they are getting
much faster, and one or two of the longer
distance records have been captured by Russian
horses; very soon they will be quite the equals
of Americans, and in Italy and Vienna the native
trotter (which is really bred from imported
American Russian crosses), is getting very fast.
At the present time a trotter to be a first-class
one must be able to trot in 2.8, a really extra
good one in 2.3, a pacer in 2.2 or under, as the
pacers going under two minutes are getting quite
usual almost."
</p>

<p>
"And where do the English trotters&mdash;my
trotters&mdash;come in?" inquired Gay, rather
crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer smiled.
</p>

<p>
"As to the English trotter," he said, "there is
no such thing.  A horse is not a trotter unless
he can trot a mile in 2 minutes 30 seconds, or
faster, and no English horse can do that.  All
the horses racing in England are American
horses, or of American parentage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come!" protested Carlton.  "What
about hackneys?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course there are legends of wonderful
times made by hackneys in England early in
the last century," said Rensslaer, "but when one
considers the shady nature of trotting in those
days, and the rough way of measuring distances&mdash;from
such a milestone to such a milestone
(and sometimes a milestone was shifted during
the night before a match)&mdash;there is no way of
being sure of any records."
</p>

<p>
"You won't leave us a leg to stand on," sighed
Gay.  "I suppose <i>you'll</i> end by trotting a mile a
minute!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the average speed of trotters in
America increases year by year.  Ages ago, a
professor worked out how long it would be before
a horse trotted in two minutes the mile, but it
was trotted several years before the time he had
prophesied, though this was accounted for by the
improvement in sulkies.  You see, the original
high-wheeled sulky with iron tyres weighed sixty
or more pounds, and some eight years ago the
ball-bearing, pneumatic-tyred, bicycle-wheeled
sulky was invented, weighing only twenty-three
pounds or less, and this makes a difference of
three or four seconds in the mile, so the
two-minute trotter came before his time."
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell nodded.
</p>

<p>
"In hers, you mean," he said.  "Lou Dillon.
What were her best times?"
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer ticked them off on his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"In 1903, at Cleveland, a mile in two minutes
two and three-quarter seconds," he said; "the
same year at Readville, two minutes dead, and
the best of all, one minute fifty-eight and a half
at Memphis.  That's travelling for you, isn't
it&mdash;though the last time was made with a
pace-maker, and a wind-shield in front.  But that
doesn't get away from the fact that the distance
was covered in the time."
</p>

<p>
"How wonderful!" Gay exclaimed, thinking
into what insignificance paled Silver Streak's
performance at Inigo Court against such lightning
speed.
</p>

<p>
"Dan Patch, too, the champion pacer," said
Rensslaer reflectively.  "He paced to a record
of one minute fifty-nine and a half, which stands,
though his absolute best was one minute fifty-six
and a quarter with a wind-shield in front.  Star
Pointer was another pacer who did the mile in
one fifty-nine and a quarter, with no assistance.
Then the best American tracks are mile tracks, and
the English are all two laps to the mile.  Horses
which trot in England cannot equal the times
they made in America, the tracks being at least
five seconds slower&mdash;that is to say, a horse which
can trot in 2.10 in the States is not likely to go
faster than 2.15 on an English track when he
comes over to England."
</p>

<p>
Carlton looked at the speaker keenly.
</p>

<p>
Like most great men, Rensslaer was the
essence of modesty, and not one word had he said
about his own stable, of certain famous horses
that he had driven in England faster than their
American records, driven with a superb skill that
the public unfortunately seldom had a chance of
appreciating, as he did not exhibit.
</p>

<p>
"Do record-breaking Trotters cost much?"
inquired Gay, thinking of the modest five
hundred that the Professor never ceased to
quote as an instance of mad extravagance.
</p>

<p>
"As much as twenty-one thousand pounds
has been given for a Trotter, and eight to twelve
thousand pounds for a horse for driving on the
road is quite common," said Rensslaer.  "A
nine-year-old gelding has been known to fetch
six thousand, and is, of course, of no value after
his remaining few years of soundness are over."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how I wish the Professor were here!"
cried Gay, and Rensslaer looked at her inquiringly,
then said:
</p>

<p>
"You see, everywhere but in England, the
premier horse-breeding country of the world, it
has become something more than mere sport&mdash;breeding
trotters is one of the recognised means
of improving the general utility horse (and
especially the army horse) in every country
except Great Britain.  Why, in Russia there
are large studs kept up under Government
comptrole, and the same thing in France, Austria,
etc., it being recognised that the trotting horse
can do more work, and keep it up longer, than
any other breed of horse."
</p>

<p>
"And there is no such comptrole here," said
Carlton thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"No, it is a pity," said Rensslaer simply.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you race here?" exclaimed Gay
in her impulsive way, and Carlton wondered how
Rensslaer would reply without deeply offending
her new-born craze for the sport.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rensslaer, "I don't approve of
letting pacers compete with trotters, and also, I
don't like the mile-and-a-half handicap racing
from standing post&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you're proud," said Gay sadly, and
at that moment the door opened to admit Chris,
who, true to his creed, gave no sign of his deep
disappointment at not finding Gay alone, though
a little surprised to see who her visitor was.
</p>

<p>
He, of course, knew Rensslaer well enough
by sight and reputation, but took no particular
interest in him, or his famous Elsinore stable, in
which steeplechasers, as apart from jumpers, were
conspicuous by their absence.  Like the rest of
the world, he judged Rensslaer by his Trotting
records alone.
</p>

<p>
When Gay had introduced him to Rensslaer,
the latter went on with what he had to say in the
quiet, chatting way that was so pleasant; he never
laid down the law, but was always interesting
without trying to be.
</p>

<p>
"I must confess," he said, "that I like Class
racing in mile heats.  This means that trotters
in any given race must belong to that "class";
for instance the 2.20 class is for horses which
have not got a record faster than 2 minutes 20
seconds for a mile.  The horses have a flying
start, the race is trotted in heats of a mile each,
with twenty minutes' interval between heats,
the horse winning three heats first, getting first
prize.  Now, by the English handicap method, a
fast horse has to start behind, and it "breaks his
heart," and spoils a good horse, to have to try and
make up several hundred yards to catch a little
shuffling butcher's pony, who has been given that
start of him.  It is like making a man fight a
boy, the man with his hands tied behind his back
so that he cannot defend himself, and after a few
such races a good horse gets sick of the whole
thing, and is spoilt as a race Trotter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Gay, all the more indignantly that
at the moment she caught Chris's eye with a
world of meaning in it, "you are trying to put
me off Trotting&mdash;and I <i>won't</i> be put off!  After
all," she added naïvely, "I'm glad you are not
racing, for I've set my heart on winning the
Gold Vase."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you may," he said heartily, feeling
that every moment he liked her better.  "But
apart from racing, the fact is, your roads are not
made for trotters and pacers, and if you want
something showy, you prefer a hackney.  In
short, you run to dogcarts, not road wagons;
you're a sociable people&mdash;and in my opinion
nothing will ever establish Trotting as a favourite
sport in England."
</p>

<p>
Chris gave Gay a comical look, and picked up
the <i>Looking-Glass</i> (that he had already seen,
much to his disgust) which lay on a table near.
</p>

<p>
"Someone sent the Professor a copy," said
Gay carelessly.  "It had a note of interrogation
against it, and was meant to be rude, I think.  I
wonder who it is that takes so much trouble about
poor little me?"
</p>

<p>
The door opened pat on the question, and
Lossie Holden came in, a radiant apparition, but
as Rensslaer was introduced, "society," he said
to himself, then glancing at Gay, added "sport"
with appreciative emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"What are you looking at?" she said coolly,
and took the <i>Looking-Glass</i> from Chris's hand.
"How nice!  You might almost have posed
for it, Gay!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" Gay inquired.  "But I
didn't, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," Lossie agreed.  "As if you
<i>could</i>!"  But meeting Chris's eyes, she looked
away&mdash;he had an excellent idea of who had sent
the <i>Looking-Glass</i> to the Professor, and she
knew it.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you drive yourself, Miss
Lawless?" said Rensslaer quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I only dared!" cried Gay warmly, and
clasped her hands together eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rensslaer, "in Berlin there was
an outcry when a lady drove for me, but in Vienna
it was otherwise&mdash;quite a feather in the lady's
cap, in short.  But then everything is done in
such a nice way that it is a pleasure to race there,
and the Trotting races are the most fashionable
sport in Vienna."
</p>

<p>
Chris's face was grave&mdash;the thing was getting
beyond a joke.  It was all Mackrell's fault, and
bad enough, without Rensslaer coming along to
encourage wilful Gay in defying public opinion at
a sport that his own refusal, and that of Vancouver
and others, to take up in England, had practically
declared to be unfit for gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" repeated Rensslaer, as he rose
to go, and at something in his voice Gay coloured.
Surely it could not be possible that he had seen
her driving Silver Streak round the track at
Inigo Court!  But already she knew him well
enough to be sure that he would not peach on
her, and she longed to see him alone, that they
might discuss at their ease his daring suggestion.
Gay earnestly begged of him to come again
soon, but neither Mackrell nor Chris displayed
any marked cordiality on taking leave of him.
Lossie only was gracious, that being her way
with millionaires.
</p>

<p>
"He seems to regard Trotting as a sort of
public-house show," said Carlton, when the other
had departed, and Chris remarking rather audibly
that Rensslaer was not far out, Gay promptly
turned her back on him, and devoted herself to
the comforting of her fellow-patron of the noble
sport.
</p>

<p>
Very shortly, therefore, with a composure that
completely hid his disgust at an exceedingly
disagreeable afternoon, instead of the happy one
with dear little Gay that Chris had expected,
he made his farewells, and departed.
</p>

<p>
Gay, relenting, called out after him:
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget that the Ffolliott's dance is on
Friday!"  But Chris had by no means forgotten.
In his own mind he had fixed on that special
evening to ask Gay a most particular question,
and now that, as he expressed it, she seemed like
going "an awful mucker," with Mackrell's assistance,
it was more than ever important that he
should ask it, and have the right to protect her
from herself&mdash;and others.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
GAY DISPOSES
</h3>

<p>
The Professor, Gay said, was always late.  It
was her solemn conviction that he would be
late for his own funeral, so she considered
herself lucky to get to the Ffolliott's dance at
all, but better late than never.
</p>

<p>
Chris and Carlton Mackrell "ran her to
earth," as the former expressed it, the moment
she entered the ballroom, and with other men
clamouring for dances, her programme was soon
full.  In vain had application been made by both
Chris and Carlton days in advance; Gay's rule
was firm.
</p>

<p>
"I never give dances away before I get there,"
she said.  "I regard myself as public property
on such occasions, and it's a case of 'first come,
first served.'  It's very unfair to the men who go
to dances to find a girl's card full before they have
a chance, and I won't do it."
</p>

<p>
So Chris had got those supper dances, reflected
Carlton Mackrell presently, but she had been
liberal also to himself, and he was leading her
away when the Professor suddenly exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"What time is supper?"
</p>

<p>
"Supper!  Why, you've only just got here!
What are you thinking about?" exclaimed Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Supper," Frank Lawless answered mildly,
with no intention of being funny.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't long had your dinner, you
greedy old thing," Gay reminded him as she
moved away, "but <i>do</i> put your tie straight!"
</p>

<p>
She never had any trouble in finding the
Professor, however big the crowd in which he
might be.  She had only to look for a tall man
standing on one leg in a doorway, with his white
tie under his left ear, and there he was.
</p>

<p>
On the rare occasions when he attended a
dance, he possessed his soul in patience till
supper-time, when he did ample justice to the
good things provided, after which he sought a
secluded corner, and went to sleep until such
time as Gay was ready to depart.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't asked me for a dance yet,
Frank," said a voice in well-pretended tones
of offence behind him, and his meditations&mdash;upon
supper&mdash;being thus rudely interrupted, he
turned to make apologies to Lossie, who in
spite of her beauty and elegance was never
surrounded in a ballroom like Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we have this one?" she inquired,
much to the Professor's surprise and confusion.
"Come along"&mdash;and before he could remonstrate,
she had manœuvred him among the couples
waltzing by, and he was executing his old-fashioned
steps, precisely if not briskly.  After
one circuit of the room, accomplished with
difficulty, and much bumping against indignant
couples, owing to erratic steering, the Professor
stopped abruptly and made a rush from the
room, dragging Lossie by the arm with him.
He subsided upon a couch in an exhausted
condition, and producing an enormous red silk
handkerchief, mopped his heated brow with it.
</p>

<p>
"You're only a bit out of practice," she said,
pretending not to notice his little gasps for
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we have the supper ones?" she said.
"I've kept them for you, and one square in the
second half."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, certainly," Frank Lawless replied,
scratching his initials on her programme, "but
<i>don't</i> be late for supper.  Draughty, dangerous
things dances," and he shook his head disapprovingly.
</p>

<p>
Chris Hannen, who had long had his suspicions
of Miss Lossie's intentions on the Professor
(failing Carlton Mackrell), strolled up, intent on
mischief, and Lossie, pretending to see a friend
in the distance, left the two men together.
</p>

<p>
"Rather out of training, eh, Professor?" said
Chris chaffingly.  "Not quite clean inside, as they
say.  Come down to Epsom for a few days, and
ride a gallop or two; do you a world of good."
</p>

<p>
The Professor shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"I have not ridden for some years," he said,
"though I was considered a good horseman as a
boy.  Not across country," he explained.  "I used
to ride every day in the park."
</p>

<p>
"On a fat pony with a leading rein, no doubt,"
Chris thought to himself.
</p>

<p>
"I never jumped anything," the Professor went
on earnestly, "but I could hold my own on the
flat&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of your back," Chris supplemented.
</p>

<p>
"And I never hunted&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Chris believed him, as he waxed indignant over
the cruelty done to the fox in fox-hunting.
</p>

<p>
"Why not trail a red herring across the country
and let the hounds follow?" he demanded
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"If only some fox-hunters could get hold of
you," cried Gay, who had come up behind them,
"there wouldn't be a bit of you left!"
</p>

<p>
Chris chuckled as he led the girl away, but the
eminent gentleman-jockey did not look his old,
confident self that evening, and Gay put her own
construction on it, as the band struck up a lively
waltz.
</p>

<p>
"You're overtrained, old chap," she said, "too
fine drawn&mdash;wasting again, I suppose, to ride
another glorious winner, or achieve a more than
usually severe purler"; but she did not, as she
would once have done, smile as she said it.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, "I'm not overtrained, and
I'm not anticipating another 'downer' just yet&mdash;not
at racing anyhow," he added to himself, his
face becoming serious.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of turns, to Gay's disappointment,
for he was a perfect dancer, Chris steered
her towards one of the doors, and led her down a
corridor to a sitting-out place, which looked more
secluded than it was.
</p>

<p>
Here he deposited the astonished Gay, and sat
down beside her.  He said nothing for a moment
or two, and when he spoke, perhaps she had an
inkling of what was coming.
</p>

<p>
"Gay, dear," he said, "I've got something to
say to you, and I don't know how to begin."
</p>

<p>
He turned, and looked at her in her pretty
white frock, and little Empire wreath of vivid
green leaves, but made no effort to take her hand
or touch her, for he was particularly undemonstrative,
and disliked nothing more than to see
a man "mauling" a woman about&mdash;a description
he applied to the average man's way of making love.
</p>

<p>
Gay said nothing.  She longed to be able to
help him, and to save him pain if she could, for
now the inkling had become a conviction, and
oh! how she did wish that he wouldn't&mdash;  Free
from all conceit as she was, she hated to have to
give him the answer she had given so many
other men.
</p>

<p>
And she was not far out, as Chris's words,
very much to the point, proved.
</p>

<p>
"Will you marry me, Gay?" he said, very
quietly, but with a little tremor in his clear
voice.  "I know it's great cheek asking you, and
I can't do it in the proper way&mdash;the way they do
in books, I mean," he explained.
</p>

<p>
Although very nervous, Gay could not repress
a smile.
</p>

<p>
"We've known each other a considerable time
now, and though, of course, while my mother was
alive, the idea of marriage never occurred to me,
for she made me so happy&mdash;" he paused, then
blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"You must not think that I'm asking you to
fill her place, or make up to me for her loss&mdash;no
one could ever do that, not even you, dear little
girl."
</p>

<p>
Gay, with tears in her eyes, in quick sympathy
touched his hand&mdash;even if he took this for
encouragement, she could not help it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very lonely," Chris went on, "but it's
because I love you for your dear self, and think
the world and all of you, that I ask you to marry
me.  I'm very awkward at professing, I know,
but you understand, don't you?  You always do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I understand," Gay replied, as she dried
her eyes with a tiny handkerchief.  "Poor, dear
old boy, I know&mdash;but oh, Chris&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can't you?" he asked earnestly, leaning a
little towards her, his clean-cut face looking
thinner and sharper in the dim light.  "We
could be very happy."
</p>

<p>
"There are so many things in the way," Gay
said.  "It isn't because I don't care for you&mdash;you
know that.  There's Frank, you see, he's so
helpless even as it is, and without me he'd go
all to bits."
</p>

<p>
"He could live with us," suggested Chris,
eager to overcome such a trifling difficulty as
this seemed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to marry anybody for ever so
long, Chris.  Can't you understand that I want to
have a good time&mdash;be a <i>girl</i> as long as I can?"
she said a little piteously.  "And Trotting is my
last, or, rather, my new love."
</p>

<p>
"Well, think it over, and start prejudiced in
my favour if you can," said Chris, striving
hard to cover up his wound.
</p>

<p>
Never show you're hit, was a maxim of his,
and he lived up to it now, though his disappointment
was the keenest he had ever known.  It is
always the man whose daring is most determined
in the hunting field, whose nerve is unshaken by
all the obstacles to be met with over a stiff
steeplechase course, rising unruffled from a rattling
fall, who is the most gentle in all the occasions
of life, and Chris was gentle now.
</p>

<p>
"But I've got a chance," he said, with more
assurance than he felt; "while there's life there's
hope, you know, and a race is never lost till
it's won&mdash;though even then there may be an
objection," he added whimsically.
</p>

<p>
Carlton Mackrell, who came at that moment to
claim her for his dance, and knew every change
in Gay's expression, knew at once that Chris had
just asked her in vain the question that he
himself, up to now, had not done, for the simple
reason that she would not let him.
</p>

<p>
A man loses his head, is completely <i>bouleversé</i>,
when a woman stalks him, and ten to one, in
sheer nervousness he gives her the desired
opportunity, but with the unwilling woman, every
faculty comes into play to defeat the lover's
purpose.  She develops strategic powers of a
high order, is an adept at keeping others round
her, in never being really alone with him, and
while it is warming, exciting work for the girl, it
is an intensely irritating experience for the man.
The brute crashes straight through all obstacles
to his end; a chivalrous gentleman bides his time,
as Carlton bided his, and in waiting, loses his
chance more often than not.
</p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
RENSSLAER <i>PACE</i> MACKRELL
</h3>

<p>
It was curious how that opportunity never
arrived, and Carlton came to regret very
heartily the introduction that had resulted in
the rapid installation of Rensslaer as a friend of
Gay's.
</p>

<p>
Here was a man who had forgotten all that
Carlton ever knew about Trotting, entirely
superseding him as mentor to Gay, and
enjoying all those sweets of her society that
the lover had promised himself when she took
up the sport, yet he could hardly be said to feel
jealous, for love seemed the last thing likely to
occupy Rensslaer's mind, and women, as women,
held not the slightest attraction for him.
</p>

<p>
The two men had nothing in common, were
almost antipathetic even, for Rensslaer was
always doing things, Mackrell only hovering on
the brink; even Chris, enthusiastic, dare-devil,
lovable, had a definite aim and pursued it, but
Mackrell unhappily lacked the lash of need, the
spur of ambition, and had been gradually degenerating
into an idle, cynical, self-centred egoist
when he met Gay, and to obtain her became the
one object and passion of his life.
</p>

<p>
Gay, on her part, felt a lively gratitude to him
for having introduced her to Rensslaer; the man
was so intensely interesting, and so completely
unconscious of it, that he was a constant surprise
to her, and she never knew a dull moment in his
company.  With animals he was perfectly charming,
as Gay quickly discovered, and when one
day she asked him if he thought there would
be horses in Heaven, he replied with perfect
simplicity that he was <i>sure</i> of it, as cats would
be there.
</p>

<p>
Gay had rather demurred to this, as she
liked dogs better, but the Connaught Square cat
being slung round his neck at that moment, she
swallowed the idea at a gulp, and was delighted
to find that if he had deeply studied the subject
of religion, he yet held a very definite belief in a
future state, though possibly he believed it to be
a more workaday one than she did.  It was to
be a world very much like this one, in which we
continue the work we have done here, only under
better conditions, with a knowledge of our past
mistakes to profit by&mdash;and such animals as were
the friends of man were to be there; of horses,
dogs, and cats he felt certain&mdash;especially cats, as
he had already told Gay.
</p>

<p>
If it was in sport that he excelled, and there
Gay was with him heart and soul, their friendship
had its serious side also.  It was, indeed, through
accidentally taking up a book lent to her, that the
Professor afterwards discovered the "Trotting
man," as he called him, to be one of the finest
classical scholars in the world, a good mathematician,
and owner of one of the finest libraries of
rare editions extant, and Gay declared she could
not get in a word edgeways when the two men
met, and discussed learned scientific problems.
</p>

<p>
The great disparity in their age enabled her to
say to him, what she never would have done to
either of the younger men, and one day she
confided to him her intense desire to drive
herself in a Trotting match&mdash;she knew it was wicked
and quite impossible, but she had never longed
for anything so much in her life!
</p>

<p>
She blushed vehemently as she said it, and
Rensslaer smiled&mdash;nothing could be kinder,
more humorous, than that smile.
</p>

<p>
"I've always meant to own up, Miss Gay," he
said, "but I saw you that time you took a trial
spin at Inigo Court&mdash;and uncommonly well you
did it, too, for a beginner."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Gay, and caught her breath,
then leaning forward, said almost in a whisper:
"I'm just dying to do it again.  I've been
<i>possessed</i> with the idea ever since you told me a
lady drove for you in Vienna!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" he said again, in that way of his
that no one else had, and which made impossibilities
not only possible, but easy.  "I'll take
you down to Inigo any day you like after
to-morrow, and you shall drive one horse, and
I drive another&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Gay sat erect, quivering with eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"The Professor mustn't know&mdash;or Lossie,"
she said.  "I'll get my friends at Flytton to
ask me down on Wednesday, and tell Frank
so&mdash;it's awful being so deceitful, isn't it?" she
added deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be doing no harm," said Rensslaer,
getting up to go, for he was at that time a very
busy man&mdash;at a Hackney Show one day, in
Paris the next, all his arrangements to make for
Olympia.  Yet like most busy men he was never
in a hurry, and such an economist in time, that he
literally made it where lazy people could find
none, and also do those kindnesses that the idle
do not.
</p>

<p>
The Professor rather bristled at the idea of
Flytton, but fortunately Lossie did not call that
day, so Gay escaped in good time the following
morning, and on arriving at the course found
Rensslaer there before her, superintending the
harnessing by Tugwood of two horses to two
speed wagons.
</p>

<p>
One horse was "Marvellous" (record 2.8½), the
other a young one bred in Austria, which was
being prepared for the Austrian Derby.
</p>

<p>
Gay was put in behind Marvellous, and after
the hand-loops on the reins were adjusted the
right length for her, she was told to jog once
round the wrong way of the track, and then turn
and stand at the starting-post.
</p>

<p>
She found the mare had a perfect mouth, but
kept giving little twitches with her nose to get
her head free, and when the girl stopped as
directed, the American came up, and let down
the mare's check-rein.
</p>

<p>
"The race you are supposed to be driving, is
the usual English mile and a half handicap
heat," he said; "yours is the scratch horse,
consequently you will start from here, and go
three times round the track, the full mile and
a half."
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded.
</p>

<p>
"My horse," continued Rensslaer, "is reckoned
to be the limit horse.  I will start 210 yards
in front of you.  Handicapping is supposed
to be with the idea your horse can trot the
mile and a half, at the rate of 2 minutes 30
seconds for the mile, the mile and a half therefore,
in 3 minutes 45 seconds.  Every ten yards means,
roughly, one second, so my horse being put 210
yards in front of you, means that he is supposed
to be 21 seconds slower than yours for a mile and
a half, that is to say, he has to trot at the rate of
a mile in 2 minutes 44 seconds, to make a dead
heat of it with you."
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded again comprehendingly, her eyes
sparkling with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"You must drive so as to gradually overtake
me," went on Rensslaer, "but not starting too
fast, or you would pump your mare, if she could
really only trot a 2.30 gait, and you must not
overtake me till you get into the back stretch the
third time.  I have given you a very fast mare,
so as to make you judge speed, and also so as to
make it easier for you to be sure of overtaking
me, as I intend to drive strictly at no faster speed
than 2.44 for the mile."
</p>

<p>
"And fast enough, too," thought Gay, her
heart beating a little too quickly for comfort.
</p>

<p>
"Carry this watch in your left palm, slipping
the strap over your hand," said Rensslaer, "so
that you can see what speed you are going.  Try
and drive the quarter miles in 37½ seconds till
you come up with me, which should be, if you
drive to this time, thirty yards from the winning
post."
</p>

<p>
He then hooked up Marvellous' check-rein,
and told Gay to walk the mare back from her
starting-post twenty yards, turn back again, and
so on till she saw him at his mark, and then
stand still at her mark.
</p>

<p>
Tugwood stepped into the centre of the grass
plot, and held a pistol in the air.  The moment
Marvellous saw his arm raised (she had been
thoroughly schooled to this), she fixed her eyes
and ears in his direction, and commenced to
tremble slightly.
</p>

<p>
As the smoke came from the pistol, before
Gay could hear the report, Marvellous jumped
forward with a jerk that nearly threw her out
backwards, and landed on a square trot.  She
was so much stretched out that she seemed two
inches lower than when standing, and was sending
the earth in quick hoof-fulls on to Gay's chest.
It was lucky, the girl thought, her eyes were
protected by goggles.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had got over her surprise, Gay
found she was gaining very rapidly on her teacher,
and close to the first quarter pole.  Glancing
hurriedly at her watch, she found, to her horror,
that the quarter was done in 35 seconds, a 2.20
gait, so she said, "Hoo, girl," and took a
steadying pull at the mare, who came back to her at
once, although by the way she shook her head,
she did not seem to like it.
</p>

<p>
As Gay drove, she thought that, as she had
made up 2½ seconds too much in the first quarter,
she should drive the next in 40 seconds to make
the proper average, but when she got to the
second quarter mile she found she had overdone
it, and Rensslaer was sailing away a full half of
the track in front of her.
</p>

<p>
She therefore determined to rely on her own
judgment of how fast she should gain on him, and
gave a gentle click to Marvellous, who instantly
lowered her head, and began to strike out,
gaining rapidly on Rensslaer; as she came into
the back stretch the third time she was just
behind him.
</p>

<p>
Round the last turn she drew up to him on the
outside, and, in spite of the much greater distance
her mare had to go in turning, held her place, and
passed him just as they came into the straight.
The mare shot out of herself, and drew so rapidly
clear of Rensslaer that Gay thought she would
make a close finish of it, and took back her mare
sharply.  This was a fatal mistake, as Rensslaer
shot up alongside, and before she could set her
mare going again, he had won by a head, in 3.45½.
</p>

<p>
She looked so taken aback that he controlled
a smile as he told her not to be disappointed,
as it would be a good lesson to her, never to
slacken speed enough to let herself be caught in
that way, but he also told her that it was bad
tactics to be alongside another horse at the turns,
as it takes so much more out of your horse.
</p>

<p>
Here ended Gay's first Trotting lesson at the
hands of a great expert, and if she had been
too ignorant, too excited even, to appreciate the
marked difference between "Marvellous" and
the Trotters owned by Mackrell and herself, she
had yet realised that this last experience of
driving herself was something very different to
that first essay in which Rensslaer had surprised
her.  For many a night after, she would wake
up, throbbing with excitement, hoping that she
would find her dream, in which she re-lived those
glorious moments in a real race, a fact.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! if I only dared!" she thought, but the
plain truth was that she did not dare.  There
was the Professor&mdash;the world&mdash;and&mdash;yes&mdash;<i>Chris</i>
... though she scarcely owned it to herself,
Carlton's opinion did not count.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
SANDOWN GRAND MILITARY
</h3>

<p>
"Heron," cried Gay, waving a letter at him,
across the breakfast table one morning early in
March, "I've got an invitation for you!  Effie
and Tom Bulteel are taking their coach down to
Sandown to-day, and they want us to go with
them.  I heard all about it the other night,"
she confided laughingly, "but I knew if I told
you of the treat that was in store, you'd plead an
engagement, or shuffle out of it somehow, and I
<i>do</i> so want you to come!  A day in the open will
do you no end of good, and you'll get a ripping
lunch (the Professor's face brightened a little),
though you'll have to do without your afternoon
nap, you know, unless you get inside the coach."
</p>

<p>
The Professor moved uneasily in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you drag me into all these things?"
he asked pathetically.  "You know how I detest
society, and you promised to leave me in peace if
I went to the dance with you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," Gay agreed, "but Effie made
quite a point of your coming to-day; you&mdash;you
amuse her so, you know."
</p>

<p>
The Professor did not appear struck with this
form of flattery, and half suspected that it was
a plot between Gay and Mrs. Bulteel to make
him appear to throw a mantle of respectability
over his sister's racing divagations.  Yet he had
a sneaking desire to see for himself what there
was in racing to make so many empty-headed
people happy, and when he feebly urged that he
had got nothing to wear, she knew that the
game was won.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, you have," she replied promptly,
"that pepper and salt suit of yours&mdash;you know,
the one you wear on your holidays.  It's quite
respectable&mdash;quite sporting-looking, in fact&mdash;and
you can wear your 'Trilby' hat.  (She exploded
inwardly.)  Altogether your rig-out's splendid,
and I shouldn't wonder if people took you for
a trainer!"
</p>

<p>
Frank Lawless looked offended, and made
another attempt to escape.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be entirely out of it," he said.  "There
is much to do in there"&mdash;he nodded towards the
distant laboratory.  "Can't you make some
excuse for me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't," the girl answered firmly.
"You're very seldom seen anywhere with
me, you know, Frank, and people must
wonder whether my brother is not a myth.
Once you start, you're sure to enjoy yourself,
and perhaps there'll be a job for you
if one of the soldier-jockeys comes to the
ground."
</p>

<p>
But even the prospect of a "case" did not
console the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," he said gravely; "you shouldn't
joke about such things, Gay," and he shook
his head reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Truly, I hope it won't be Chris," the girl
answered, drumming her fingers on the table,
and looking thoughtful.  "He's riding in the
Gold Cup, you know&mdash;a horse he trained himself."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the Professor with a deep sigh,
"as it appears to be my duty, I'll come.  I hope
they won't talk horses to me, though," looking
up anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"If they do, agree with everything they say,"
Gay instructed him, "because you don't know
enough to contradict, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have my own ideas," he answered
complacently, while Gay devoutly hoped he would
give utterance to none of them, or she foresaw a
rude awakening before him.
</p>

<p>
"We must leave here by eleven for Eaton
Square," she said, "so toddle upstairs in half-an-hour,
and change your clothes.  I'll put everything
out for you, including a pair of race-glasses,
so you'll <i>look</i> the part, at any rate, even if you
don't feel it."
</p>

<p>
When the Professor reappeared again, after an
absence of an hour, he looked very nice and
archaic, as Gay told him, though by no means
happy.
</p>

<p>
"I am cold," he announced (and indeed his
own skin was always his first consideration),
looking down at his well-worn suit; "these are
summer clothes, you know."
</p>

<p>
"It's a glorious day," Gay informed him;
"but of course you'll want a top-coat.  It'll be
cold driving back, I expect."
</p>

<p>
When they arrived in Eaton Square, the
Professor was hoisted on to the coach where he
held on with both hands, and otherwise delighted
Effie during the drive.  His conversation was of
a spasmodic character, interrupted by backward
glances over his shoulder whenever a corner was
turned, and he heaved an audible sigh of relief
when the coach drew up in the enclosure.
</p>

<p>
Effie surveyed the scene with approval.  Her
sympathies were not particularly with the racing,
indeed she only regarded it as a necessary evil
connected with bringing a crowd of people
together&mdash;and this was a very smart crowd
certainly.
</p>

<p>
She focussed her glasses on the moving throng
in the members' enclosure, open for this
meeting only, to non-subscribers in the way
of soldiers, and their wives and sweethearts, and
here and there she recognised someone she knew.
</p>

<p>
The Professor was cautioned on all sides to
take care of himself, but Gay took possession of
him, and hurried him off to the paddock to tout
the horses for the first race.  There were several
walking round in a circle on the crest of the hill,
and while Gay stood as close to them as she
could get, checking the numbers on the lads'
arm-badge with her card, her brother kept at a
more than respectful distance.  Presently a lad
walking a horse up behind him, nearly frightened
him out of his wits with a business-like "By y'r
leave, please," and he executed a wild leap to
safety, to the intense amusement of the onlookers.
</p>

<p>
Catching Gay's eye, he scuttled over to her,
and tried to get her away from the charmed circle,
prophesying hysterically a kick from one of the
horses.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be absurd, Frank," she replied,
watching with interest each one as it passed;
"horses can't kick when they're walking.
They're not cows."
</p>

<p>
The Professor remained unconvinced, however,
and was greatly relieved when Gay moved off in
the direction of the weighing-room to see the
numbers and jockeys, but the frame with the
mixture of figures and names conveyed nothing
to his mind.
</p>

<p>
"Halloa!  Chris rides No. 9 in this," Gay
exclaimed, "let's see what it is.  Here we
are&mdash;Mr. M'Nab's Irish Knight, four-year-old,
10st. 7lb.  I wish we could find Chris; it may be a
good thing&mdash;what he calls a 'pinch.'"
</p>

<p>
At that moment Chris Hannen came out of the
weighing-room.  A thick frieze overcoat, cut to
the knee, disclosed a thin kid workman-like pair of
boots, he wore a white scarf round his throat,
while his head was surmounted with a dark blue
racing-cap.  He was busy chatting with the
owner of Irish Knight, but as he passed through
the gate into the paddock, his quick eye noticed
Gay, while a second astonished glance discovered
the Professor.
</p>

<p>
He at once left his companion, and came
quickly towards them.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Gay?" he cried eagerly.
"Morning, Professor!  Lovely day for jumping,
isn't it?  Hope you won't be wanted" (the
Professor shuddered).  "Excuse my apparent
rudeness in not taking off my cap, Gay, but I've
been tied into it."
</p>

<p>
Gay thought, with a pang, how drawn he
looked, "but how workman-like!" a moment after.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't tell me you had two rides to-day,"
Gay said, as the three walked off to look at the
horse.
</p>

<p>
"No," Chris replied, as they turned down the
hill on the left to the saddling-stalls.  "I didn't
know myself till just now.  M'Nab couldn't do
the weight himself, so he asked me."
</p>

<p>
"And is it a jewelled-in-every-hole,
compensated-balance 'pinch,' Chris?" Gay asked,
laughing, as she stood by watching the trainer
place the tackle on Irish Knight.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not, though I've got more than an
outside chance.  I can't advise you to gamble
heavily on this occasion, but perhaps a trifle each
way will show a profit.  You ought to get ten to
one in this field."
</p>

<p>
The horse was led out, and Chris took off his
coat, and handed it to the lad.  His owner,
looking very disappointed at not having the ride
himself, saw Chris chucked up, then walked beside
him to the plantation avenue leading to the course.
As they disappeared, with a wave of the hand
from Chris, Gay turned to her brother, and cried
enthusiastically:
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't Chris look ripping on a horse?
And can't he ride, too, just!  Let's get on the
stand and watch the race, and I <i>must</i> have
half-a-sovereign even, and place on him for luck."
</p>

<p>
With one of the men on the rails she placed
her wager, getting eight's and even money for a
place, then she and the bewildered and annoyed
Professor mounted the stand, to watch the horses
go down.  There were nine runners, all soldier-ridden,
a well-known amateur who rode a lot in
Ireland being up on the favourite.
</p>

<p>
They all got safely over the first two fences,
and as they galloped past the enclosure, Gay
pointed out Chris's scarlet jacket and blue cap,
lying fourth, to her brother.
</p>

<p>
Each time the horses jumped, he gave a convulsive
little leap into the air himself, screwing
his eyes up painfully, and only half looking at the
fences.
</p>

<p>
"Terribly dangerous!" he muttered.  "If
one of those fellows fell off, he must be
killed."
</p>

<p>
"Stuff!" was Gay's rejoinder.  "Men who
play this game are not so soft and brittle as you,
old boy.  There they are again," pointing to the
left as the horses made the bottom turn.  They
were all on their legs still, and as the Professor
fumbled with the glasses, he devoutly hoped they
would remain so.  For a surgeon he was a
remarkably nervous man, though he could operate
with skill and precision, with no thought but for
the work in hand.  But he could not look at an
accident, or anticipate one, without infinitely more
suffering&mdash;mentally&mdash;than the actual victim, and
Gay wondered what he would do if, as sometimes
happened, half-a-dozen men were all on the
ground together ... which was precisely what
happened, and it did not need the terrified squeal
beside her to inform Gay, that under a <i>mêlée</i> of
men and horses, had disappeared a certain scarlet
jacket and blue cap.
</p>

<p>
If Gay had ever doubted which it was of the
two men laying such close siege to her, she loved,
she had no doubt at all when, through her glasses,
she saw a small patch of colour lying perfectly
still, and in the same moment discovered that the
Professor had vanished.
</p>

<p>
If terror had wrung from him that involuntary
squeal, all his professional instincts&mdash;and they
were the keenest he possessed&mdash;were instantly
aroused by a "case," and he precipitated himself
from the stand with a rapidity that left Gay far
behind, and never stopped running till he had
reached Chris.  No other doctor had yet put
in an appearance, and with quick, clever fingers
the Professor made a cursory examination, and
issued his orders rapidly and to the point, here
was the cool, astute surgeon, recognised as such
and instantly obeyed, as he superintended Chris's
removal.  The list of injuries when tabulated
proved a heavy one.  There was no fracture of
the skull, but severe concussion of the brain, a
collar bone and three ribs broken, also a hip put
out, but no internal injuries as far as could be
ascertained.  Epsom was nearer than town, and
the Professor decided to take Chris straight home
in an ambulance, and remain the night with him,
afterwards placing him in charge of a local doctor,
if no complications ensued.
</p>

<p>
This he presently hurriedly explained to Gay,
who, though deathly white, was quite composed;
her spirits rose even at the report, for though
Chris had had few worse "outings" than this one,
at least he was alive.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt Mrs. Bulteel will look after you,"
added the Professor, as he rushed away, and
Effie did, knowing well enough that if Chris
Hannen had lost his race, and almost his life
that day, he had beyond all question only
established more firmly his claim on Gay's
heart.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
A BEAUTIFUL CASE
</h3>

<p>
"It was a beautiful case," said the Professor,
looking rapturously at Gay through his glasses,
and he fired off a lot of technical terms that she
did not in the least understand, but inwardly
shuddered at, for it was Chris's flesh and bones
of which he was speaking, and he wound up by
telling her of the cemetery so conveniently placed
for jockeys under the hill at Epsom.
</p>

<p>
"When are you going to see him again?"
inquired Gay, sitting down to hide a sudden
faintness.
</p>

<p>
"I have placed him in charge of an excellent
man at Epsom," said the Professor in the superior
way in which one doctor speaks of another, "but
I shall overlook him, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Take me when you go," pleaded Gay.  "I
could speak to Chris through the door, you know,
and it might buck him up."
</p>

<p>
"More slang," said the Professor resignedly.
"And&mdash;ah&mdash;Epsom Downs is not <i>quite</i> the place
for a young lady, my dear&mdash;the air is so strong
and keen, it nearly takes your head off&mdash;"  And
indeed he looked more alive than he had done
any time these ten years.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if his mother knows," she said, and
her voice trembled.  We seldom weep at things
we <i>feel</i>, it is in the attempt to put them into
words that we break down, and quite unexpectedly
a tear rolled down her cheek.
</p>

<p>
A tear with Gay was so unprecedented an
occurrence, that the Professor realised the severe
nervous strain the girl had passed through, and
that had kept her sleepless during the past night,
but before he could make up his mind to try and
comfort her, Gay had vanished, blaming herself
for her lack of pluck.
</p>

<p>
After all, Chris lived, and that was everything;
but oh! she hated sport&mdash;hated anything to do
with horses.  She had taken Chris's steeple-chasing
more or less light-heartedly till the
accident to which she had been an eye-witness,
she had only <i>heard</i> of the others&mdash;become used
to his disappearances while being patched up.
But now she knew, in one lightning flash, that
she could not bear to live with the constant dread
before her of his being killed, or dragging out a
maimed existence, and with her usual decision of
character, came to the conclusion that Chris
would have to choose between racing and herself.
</p>

<p>
She fell to wondering if Mrs. Summers would
be offended if she sent down by the Professor
some of her famous strong mock turtle soup, and
she hoped his beef tea would be made properly,
one part beef, one mutton, one veal.  She was
still thinking about it when her cousin walked in,
unannounced, of course, as most undesirable
things are.
</p>

<p>
"So Chris is going on all right," said Lossie,
thus proving that she had already looked up the
Professor.  "Awful good sort, isn't he?" she
added, in a tone of pretended warmth, for as she
wanted Carlton Mackrell for herself, she never
missed a chance of pointing out Chris's charms
to Gay.
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded, and, in an effort to calm herself,
took up a bit of needlework, and began to plant
delicate, intricate stitches.  It was significant,
perhaps, that no one ever saw Lossie with a
needle in her hand, and as she had no maid, how
she got mended was a mystery.
</p>

<p>
"You look awfully bad," said Lossie frankly.
"But if you feel like that, why not marry Chris
Hannen when he gets up, and have done with it?
Steeplechasing doesn't begin again till the autumn,
and you may as well be his wife as his widow."
</p>

<p>
Gay paled.  Lossie had brutally enough hit
the right nail on the head.  It was because she
could not bear to own Chris, then lose him, that
she must keep him at arm's length&mdash;be his
comrade rather than his wife, which was by no
means what Chris wanted!
</p>

<p>
"How is Aunt Lavinia?" she said, abruptly
changing the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Just as idiotic as ever.  Sent five pounds to
Barnardo's Homes yesterday, and refused to pay
my hat bill."
</p>

<p>
Gay looked disgusted, knowing that the sweet
lady's life was one long struggle to balance
Lossie's dressmaking bills and her own private
charities, the result being that she had not a frock
or bonnet good enough to play chaperon in, so
that Lossie was dependent on her friends and
Gay to take her about.
</p>

<p>
"That reminds me," said Gay, "I haven't
sent my contribution yet," and she rose and went
to her writing-table, where she jotted down a
note.
</p>

<p>
"As to my dressmaker," said Lossie, "she's
going to summon me.  It's all these hateful
seasons of the year&mdash;as soon as one is straight
for spring, it's summer, then winter in the
middle of <i>that</i>&mdash;and so on.  Why can't we live
in a place where the same sort of clothes do all
the year round?"
</p>

<p>
"That blue frock you wore at the ball must
have been very expensive," said Gay hesitatingly;
"the dear aunt really does her best, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's easy for you to talk," cried Lossie
spitefully.  "One-half of the feminine world is a
pincushion, for the other rich and happy half to
stick pins in, and I don't pretend to be like Aunt
Lavinia, who would rather be the pincushion
than the pins!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure," said Gay wearily, too unhappy to
be indignant, "<i>I</i> never stuck any pins in you or
anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Well, no," admitted Lossie, who had an
excellent reason for getting Gay into a good
temper, "<i>you</i> don't, but every woman is given
two chances of happiness in life, a rich father, or
an adequate husband&mdash;or both&mdash;but as a matter
of fact, the double event seldom comes off&mdash;indeed,
far more women are ruined by their fathers than
their husbands.  <i>Cherchez la femme</i> indeed!  Oh,
it's easy enough for a girl to be gay, to be
happy, if she's rich&mdash;if men 'don't go after the
money,' they don't refuse to go where the
money is!"
</p>

<p>
Gay coloured.  She knew well enough that her
fortune counted for nothing in the eyes of at
least two men towards her&mdash;Chris couldn't and
wouldn't give up trying to win her because she
had more money than he had, and Carlton was
so rich, that if he ever cast it a thought, it was
merely as private pocket-money with which to
buy chiffons and fal-lals.
</p>

<p>
"How much will your dressmaker take off her
account?" she said, for she always preferred
coming to the point, to beating about the bush,
and she was used to these periodical attacks on
her pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty pounds would do.  Then I could
order something for&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't," said Gay, who had drawn out her
cheque-book, and begun to write.  "Lossie," she
said half sadly, as she came forward, and handed
her cousin a slip of pink paper, "why do you
bother so much about the outside of you?  Be
rice, be natural, be <i>kind</i>; don't talk scandal&mdash;men
<i>hate</i> it&mdash;"  She paused and blushed; unconsciously
she was trying to teach Lossie those
pretty manners and ways of her own that men
cherish so deeply, and to which their homage,
so long forgotten among brusque women,
inevitably sprang.
</p>

<p>
"I can't be a dear little charmer like you, Gay,
if you mean that," said Lossie, as she put the
cheque away, and warmly thanked its giver,
though after all it was no more than her right.
Those who <i>had</i>, ought to share with those who
had not, and our Labour Members' vigorous
contention that people who have money, should
be forced to provide for those who have spent
theirs, also for those who can't and won't work,
expressed her opinion exactly.
</p>

<p>
And yet the cheque did not make Lossie as
happy as usual.  In sudden flashes, now and
then, she realised her position&mdash;saw over.
Beauty she had, and brains, but up to now, and
she was twenty-seven, they had brought her little
good.  She had received no really good offers,
but it never seemed to strike her that her extreme
expensiveness in dress and tastes had a good deal
to do with it, and her absorbing (and patent)
passion for Mackrell still more.  To be sure
there was that ridiculous George Conant, at
present the favourite nephew and heir of the
enormously rich Mrs. Elkins, but as the old lady
made a new will every three months or so, and
he might do something specially idiotic to annoy
her, it would be madness to bet on <i>that</i> chance.
</p>

<p>
Poor Frank would be safe, and less trouble&mdash;anyway,
she had no intention of drifting into that
grey life in which one is first with nobody, or
worse still (for Aunt Lavinia's pension died with
her), forming one of that hopeless army of
incapables that is always "looking for something,"
and helpless, unbraced, expects a heaven-born
post to fit it, not that it should learn to fit
itself for a post.
</p>

<p>
Lossie sighed impatiently, and glanced across
at Gay, who sat, needlework in hand, in the
charming room that was feminine like herself, and
fresh and sweet, with nothing whatever about
her to suggest the Trotting or Race-course, and,
as often before, she tried to analyse the irresistible
charm of her cousin.
</p>

<p>
"A good sort" (from the women), "a <i>darned</i>
good sort" (from the men), was the invariable
verdict passed upon her, and even taking up
vulgar Trotting, and doing things men hate their
women to do, had not affected her popularity.
"The first time you see Gay Lawless you'll
hardly think her good-looking, the second you'll
fall in love with her, and the third you'll ask her
to marry you!" Lossie had once heard one man
tell another&mdash;but as to <i>beauty</i>!  It was true that
Gay's eyes had a curious power of refraction, so
that shades of feeling chased each other over
them like shadows on a clear pool, and her skin
had the clear transparency that goes with hair
that not so long ago, as Gay confidentially told
her men friends, was "carrots," though the laugh
with which she said it, showing the loveliest little
white teeth in the world, usually inclined the
person addressed to a quite contrary opinion.  But
compared with what Lossie found in her own
mirror, Gay had no good looks at all.
</p>

<p>
"I half expected Mr. Rensslaer," said Gay,
glancing at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"He's not a beauty," said Lossie, with some
irrelevance, but he was no favourite of hers, and,
on his part, he had never found reason to alter
his summing up of her on the first occasion they
had met.
</p>

<p>
"His kind face is more distinguished than
any man's I know," cried Gay with spirit.  "I
learn more from him in five minutes, than all the
stupid people I've ever known put together!"
</p>

<p>
"Including Chris?" said Lossie drily.
</p>

<p>
"Including Chris."
</p>

<p>
"Then the sooner you make yourself happy
with this pattern of all the perfections, including
a few millions, the better," said Lossie, who did
not care who Gay married, so long as it was not
Carlton.
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed.  "Wasn't it Nathaniel Hawthorn
who said that 'to have wealth beyond a certain
point, is only to undertake the labour of living the
lives of ten or a thousand men as well as your
own?'  And besides&mdash;can't you see, but of
course you can't, that a man like that must have
had his own ideal, his own romance, ages before
he ever saw silly little me?  There's a story in
his life, and no mean one, I'll wager."
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Lossie, "I don't think your
lovers are much comfort to you.  One lets you
in for a disreputable sport, another breaks your
heart by half-killing himself, and the third string
to your bow isn't in the very least in love with
you!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door opened, and
Rensslaer came in.
</p>

<p>
"So Mr. Hannen is going on all right," he
said in a tone of great pleasure as he shook
hands with Gay, and Lossie, with a vague wave
of her hand, disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;thank God!"
</p>

<p>
"Nice boy," said Rensslaer, as he sat down
opposite Gay, and she gave him a few details of
Chris's case.  There were dark rings round her
eyes&mdash;she looked really ill, and Rensslaer guessed
that if Chris's accident had shaken her into a
vivid realisation of her love for him, it had only
the more convinced her that to see his life in
almost daily jeopardy for five months out of the
year, would be more than she could bear, and that
this was the real parting of their ways.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you persuade him to give it up?"
he said abruptly; it was not the first time he had
startled her by knowing precisely of what she
was thinking.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head
</p>

<p>
"You know," she said, "Chris is too tall for
a jockey&mdash;he <i>will</i> train&mdash;and, apart from accidents,
all the tall jockeys go out quickly.  There was
Archer&mdash;there are many others.  It's sheer perversity
in a man of six feet to want to be a jock&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her voice broke, and Rensslaer bent his
head, and looked away&mdash;it struck her then that a
man's silence is more decent, and worth more
sometimes, than all a woman's sympathy, and
talk, and kisses.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps this will sicken him of the game,"
he said presently.
</p>

<p>
It might have enlightened him as to Gay's
chances of happiness to know how at that very
moment Chris, for the most part in bandages,
was using almost his first conscious moments to
have held up before his eyes by an unwilling
nurse, his note-book of "fixtures" for the
ensuing week, the while eagerly calculating his
chances of being able to ride before the last
day of the month, when steeplechasing ended.
</p>

<p>
Gay pulled herself together, but when Rensslaer
spoke of her horses and their engagements, and
the much-coveted Gold Vase, she felt that for
the time being, at any rate, she hated anything
to do with a race of any kind.
</p>

<p>
And yet it was no more than two days ago
that she had told Carlton she would break her
heart if it did not become hers, and he had by
no means forgotten....
</p>

<p>
"You must let me drive you down to Waterloo
Park," said Rensslaer, and then told her that on
the Gold Vase day, he was for once entering a
horse, and going to drive himself, though not in
competition for the Vase.
</p>

<p>
Gay hardly heard him.  She wanted to go to
the telephone and get the latest news of Chris.
The Professor, now taking some rest, was to go
down to Epsom later in the day.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE GOLD VASE
</h3>

<p>
It was not without protest on the part of the
Professor that Rensslaer drove Gay to Waterloo
Park for the race for the Gold Vase, and when,
punctually to the minute, the latter appeared in
Connaught Square with the road wagon and pair
with which he was subsequently to win first
prize in the "Road Rig Appointment Class"
at Olympia, an animated colloquy was going
forward, in which Lossie Holden bore an
animated part.
</p>

<p>
"You and Frank can come down by train if
you like," said Gay defiantly, as through the
window she saw the pair of almost thoroughbred-looking
seal brown mares, no white, with long
tails and manes.  Then, with no more ado, she
walked out, and took her place by Rensslaer's
side.
</p>

<p>
Mamie H. and Nancy Clancy, each with a
record "low down in the teens," were in the
habit, whenever their heads were loosed, of
going along at a 2.30 gait, and on the way
down to the races they went together like one
horse, without pulling or shying, or being afraid
of motors, passing everything on the road drawn
by horses, and making it lively even for the
motors.
</p>

<p>
They were harnessed a little differently to
what they are in the show ring, as instead of
collars, (which are obligatory in a pair horse
"road rig" class) they had breast or "Dutch"
collars, such as are used in Vienna for pair horse
racing, with the object of giving horses more
freedom, also the reins were of the Viennese
style, which, instead of coming together at the
coupling, have single hand-pieces, continued
double all the way, there being four reins in the
hand instead of two.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer explained that the breast collars have
terrets only on the outside, so that the inside reins
come back to the pad terrets, and give a more
direct pull on the reins than if the horses wore
collars, and Gay listened with all the eagerness of
the novice, who has the luck to get from an expert
"inside" knowledge of which the public&mdash;and
even Carlton Mackrell&mdash;knew little.
</p>

<p>
Many murmurs of "There goes Rensslaer!"
followed them on the road.  Some of the men
wondered who was the uncommonly pretty girl
with him, others, again, recognised her as the
somewhat remarkable Gay Lawless.  She wished
that the drive might last indefinitely, but all too
soon it was over, the horses averaging sixteen
miles an hour all the way down from Town to
the course.
</p>

<p>
The scene when they arrived was pretty
enough, and the attendance unusually good, as
it was known that Rensslaer was driving&mdash;an
extraordinary circumstance that had raised the
hopes of the Trotting fraternity sky-high.
</p>

<p>
The race for the Gold Vase is a handicap in
mile and a half heats, the entries, sixty, being
divided into six heats with ten horses in each
heat, with two semi-final heats for the twelve
horses who have been first and second in these
preliminary heats, and a final heat for the first and
second horses in these semi-finals.
</p>

<p>
Gay's and Carlton Mackrell's horses were both
at "scratch," but were drawn to start in different
heats, the first heat being with Carlton Mackrell's
horse scratch.
</p>

<p>
Ten horses were in this heat, the limit horse a
raw-boned, uneven-gaited trotter, ridden by a
small boy in shirt sleeves, who, the moment the
pistol went off, bolted with the boy, and tried to
jump the rails, but was brought back, and finished
the heat last, amidst the jeers of the public.
</p>

<p>
Mackrell's horse trotted very fast and steadily,
his toe weights flashing in the sun, and without a
slip or waver, without any urging, overtook one
horse after the other, had them all beaten before
the last turn, and jogged the winner in twenty
lengths in front.  Time: 3 minutes 30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
As Gay's horse had never been able to do a
trial for the distance faster than 3 minutes 36
seconds (all out), she felt very despondent, much
to the delight of Lossie, who had arrived with
the ruffled Professor in tow, and who hoped that
Gay would get such a beating that day as to
sicken her of the sport for the remainder of her
life.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer and Carlton vied with each other in
their attention to, and care of, the downcast Gay,
as they watched the next heat, in which none of
their party had horses.  A hobbled pacer was
the limit horse, and bore the name of Birmingham
Joe, although he looked a typical common
American, and English horses are not pacers;
he won, after a most desperate finish, by a short
head in 3.36.
</p>

<p>
This horse, therefore, was equal to Gay's
in speed, and with a start of 200 yards
over hers, would have a great advantage if he
got into the final, as he would not have to come
through his horses, and although he seemed very
stiff and old, such horses often improve in speed
in later heats, if they are kept moving between
heats.  Most likely, said Rensslaer, he had a low
record in the States about "the time of the flood,"
and might get some of that speed back when he
got warmed up, and worked the stiffness out of
his old legs.
</p>

<p>
Between the second and third heats there was
a curious exhibition of the Guidless trotter, Gold
Ring by Wild Brino, Mr. Wilkinson, the owner,
leading the old stallion out with a surcingle,
overhead check, and side reins, like a circus
horse, then taking him fifty yards down the
stretch, turned him to face the starter, and walked
away, the horse standing like a statue.
</p>

<p>
At the report of the pistol he darted off on a
strong trot, and not cutting the grass corners,
but keeping fairly on the track, he trotted the
full two laps for the miles in 2.24, mane and tail
flying, finishing with a spurt at his top speed.
</p>

<p>
As he passed the wire the bell was rung, when
he at once pulled up, turned slowly round, and
jogged up to Mr. Wilkinson, who was waiting for
him.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that <i>pretty</i>?" cried Gay warmly, and
forgetting all her nervous fears as they went over
to look at the big chestnut stallion, with very
high action, that won the Richmond (Surrey)
Horse Show Pace and Action Class some years ago.
</p>

<p>
"I have a good many young trotters by him,"
said Rensslaer quietly to Carlton; "he is so
exceptionally well-shaped, and has a very low
record."
</p>

<p>
The third heat was won easily by a pony with
a long start, under saddle, in 3 minutes 42 seconds.
(This pony got beaten in his semi-final.)
</p>

<p>
Between the third and fourth heats there was
much excitement when Rensslaer drove Hettie
C., the pacer (to establish a record for pacing
mares for England on a half-mile track), in a
Faber speed wagon.  She was a thoroughbred-looking
mare, but with rather a big head, dark
chestnut, and he had two men out with galloping
thorough-breds in jogging carts, one of whom
stood his horse close to the outside of the track
near the judge's stand, whilst the other cantered
behind Hettie C. as she had a few preliminary
brushes the wrong way of the track to open her
pipes.  She came out on a trot, and only got
into her pace when she got beyond a 2.50 gait.
</p>

<p>
Hettie C. did not wear hobbles, or any of the
rigging usually seen on the third-rate pacers
usually imported into England, but only quarter
and shin boots to protect her in case she stepped
into an uneven bit of footing.  She carried the
lightest of racing plates, and a rubber bit and
side check, and paced almost as upright as a
trotter, with just a flip to her fetlocks, and knees
and hocks stiff.
</p>

<p>
When she was ready, she came down for her
flying start towards "Uncle," the galloper some
four lengths behind her, but Rensslaer shook his
head, and "Uncle" did not drop the flag (for this
start was by flag, as the trial was on American
lines), and Rensslaer gradually stopped the mare,
and jogged back on a trot.
</p>

<p>
The second time the mare was going to his
satisfaction, and he nodded for "Uncle" to drop
the flag, and the trial had begun.  The people
had been asked to keep quiet, so as not to upset
the mare, and nothing was heard but the "tapa,
tapa" of the pacer's feet, and the "tip-a-tip,
tip-a-tip" of the galloper.
</p>

<p>
They got to the quarter mile in 32 seconds,
the galloper stretching out faster than a hunting
gallop, but losing ground.  Round the turn his
driver hit him, and he did all he knew, closing up
the gap, and getting to the mare's girths, the
half being done in 1 minute 3 seconds.  Here
the second galloper joined in, and as they came
to the third quarter, the first galloper was done,
and dropped back, the second galloper taking his
place alongside the mare.  This quarter was done
rather slower, in 32½ seconds, the time for the
three quarters being 1 minute 35½ seconds, the
mare beginning to tire on the heavy, sandy track.
</p>

<p>
Both drivers of the gallopers beginning to
shout, the mare made a desperate spurt, and
Rensslaer drove her out with the reins, not the
whip, and she finished (with the second galloper
head and head with her) in 31 seconds for the
last quarter, making 2 minutes 6 seconds, far
and away the best record for England.  The
first galloper cantered in behind, quite done.
</p>

<p>
There was great applause at this, the most
sensational feature (so far) of the day, and then
came the fourth heat&mdash;the heat where Gay's
horse was in at scratch.
</p>

<p>
Her driver, a very good English one,
manœuvred very well for a start, and got off
well, the horse in front of him starting badly, so
that he got clear of him at once, and sailed after
the leaders, one of which, a very small pony with
a very long lead, went zigzagging all over the
track, so that every time he tried to pass it, the
pony got in his way.  Finally, however, when
the pair of them were in the lead, it got into a
bad break, and galloped under the wire, neck and
neck with Gay's horse (of course being
disqualified), the latter winning the heat in 3
minutes 40 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Gay's horse could have done the heat faster if
he had not been so interfered with by the pony,
but this interference had taken a lot out of him,
and he seemed rather tired after the heat, and
cooled out badly.
</p>

<p>
The sixth heat was won by two lengths (of
course no horse of her party was in this) in 2.40
by "Our Tom" rather easily, and the winner
therefore looked capable of going faster in the
finals (this was the Trotter in the final heat).
</p>

<p>
Mackrell's horse was in the first semi-final
heat, but not Gay's.  Mackrell got a wonderfully
quick start, and got very soon up to the leader,
did not pass him, but kept just behind till they
came into the stretch, and then passed him,
and won in a jog by a length in 3.35.
</p>

<p>
Although he had won by only a length, so as
to not expose his horse's speed too much, he had
won so easily, that when the betting on the final
came, he was the favourite at almost any price,
as he seemed to be an absolute certainty.
</p>

<p>
Now came the second semi-final, Gay's horse
at scratch.  He got a very bad start, being half
turned round when Uncle "loosed off," and
he had a hard struggle to get up to the
horse in front of him.  As he did so, he and
that horse got up to the one in front of
them (who had made a standstill break), and
Gay's horse being in the middle, his sulky got
crushed between the other two, and though he
drew in front, it was seen that his near tyre, the
one on the outside of the turn, had come off.
</p>

<p>
Gay drew in her breath sharply, but Rensslaer
soon reassured her, for with luck and a clever
driver all was not yet lost.
</p>

<p>
The tyre had got jammed up in the axle fork,
and also the wheel, which could not revolve in
consequence, and dragged along the ground,
but by trotting his hardest, the horse still kept
gaining on the leader, although the wooden
rim of the wheel got worn through by the friction
on the track.  As the horses came round the final
turn, Gay's horse got level with the leader, and
after a desperate drive won, the wheel just
holding till the wire was passed, when collapsing,
the sulky turned over.
</p>

<p>
As it did so, the driver, seizing hold of the
harness with his left hand just above the crupper,
lifted himself forward, and putting his right hand
on to the pad, vaulted on to the horse's back, and
stopped him.
</p>

<p>
Time: 3 minutes 37 seconds.
</p>

<p>
When the driver returned to the paddock, he
was cheered by the crowd for his pluck and skill,
but Gay's horse was very exhausted, and all of a
shake, as the stuck wheel made a terrible handicap
on him in the race, he had also slightly cut his
near hind fetlock with the broken wire spokes.
</p>

<p>
The betting, which originally had been on
Gay's horse, now, as I said above, had veered
round to Mackrell's; in fact the race was
considered as good as over.
</p>

<p>
When the time came for harnessing for the
final, Rensslaer, who had been looking after
Gay's horse all the time, and found him in a very
bad state, went as a final desperate remedy to the
refreshment bar, bought a bottle of their best
champagne, and at the risk of its being considered
doping, he drenched the horse with the liquor.
The effect in a few minutes was very marked; the
horse brightened up, and seemed almost himself
again.
</p>

<p>
But the trouble was by no means over.  In the
bar Rensslaer presently found, to his horror, that
the driver of Gay's horse had been given drinks
to celebrate his plucky driving with the broken
wheel, so often, that the man was already
dead-drunk, and of no earthly use to drive.
</p>

<p>
Rapidly seeking out Gay, and drawing her
aside, Rensslaer briefly told her the state of
affairs, and offered to drive for her, but like
lightning she leaped to the longed-for opportunity,
and whispered that if he would lend her his
Faber speed wagon (in which he drove Hettie
C. in her trial pace against time earlier in the
day) she would drive the race herself.
</p>

<p>
Gay's horse was therefore harnessed to the
speed wagon; she took her place in it, and
Rensslaer tucked her well in with a light rug.
</p>

<p>
But all this took time.  The moment of the
start for the final was long past; in fact a stout
young man had been shouting "Get on your
marks," in a voice like a bull for some time,
when suddenly Gay appeared on the track behind
her horse, and after a moment's stupefied silence,
a deafening cheer rang out, succeeded by another,
and another.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
GAY DISGRACES HERSELF
</h3>

<p>
There was no time to warm up the horse; she
had to trot down fast to her mark, overshot it
some forty yards, and swung her horse round in
a hurry, spurting to get up to her mark, as
she saw "Uncle's" back with upraised pistol.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate she did so, as at that moment
the pistol went off, and she was at top speed on
to her mark as the pistol was fired, Mackrell's
horse being at a standstill at the same mark
(they were both scratch mark horses, you may
remember), she having the outside position.
</p>

<p>
Mackrell's horse was into his stride in a
moment, however; Gay and Mac raced side by
side after the leaders.  There were, of course,
only four horses in this final, one of the leaders
being the old ex-American hobbled pacer,
Birmingham Joe, who had 200 yards' start of
Gay and Mac, the fourth horse being the trotter
Our Tom, with 150 yards' start.
</p>

<p>
Gay's and Mackrell's horses trotted side by
side like a pair, rapidly overtaking the two
leaders, but Gay could see out of the corner of
her eye that Mackrell was holding his horse, and
could at any time draw clear of her if he liked.
</p>

<p>
At the turn he pulled slightly back, and let her
take the inside, and there came an ominous jeer
from the spectators when they saw him giving
way, instead of keeping the advantage he had
gained.  The moment, however, they were
round the turn, he drew up level again on the
outside, when suddenly his horse made a most
disastrous break (a horse noted for never
breaking), and every time Mac tried to catch him,
he went off into a worse break, till finally he
cantered in a long way last, the horse refusing
to trot.
</p>

<p>
Gay, of course, saw nothing of this, she only
knew that Mackrell's horse had suddenly fallen
back, and that she was gaining hand over
hand on the trotter Our Tom in front.  She
passed him as she went round the track the
second time, and calling on her horse, she saw
him stretch out his neck still further, and lower
himself till he seemed inches lower than his proper
height, whilst he began to sway his head slightly
from side to side, as he reached his utmost in each stroke.
</p>

<p>
She swept round the last turn but one at such
speed that she found she must keep her eyes
fixed on her horse's ears, as the least glance to
the side made her feel giddy, and as if she would
lose her balance, and now she got up with the
pacer in the hack stretch, who was wobbling
along in the regular third-rate pacer style,
instead of moving almost as upright as a
trotter, as Hettie C. the pacer did earlier in
the day.
</p>

<p>
A really perfect-gaited pacer has very little roll
in its gait, and if seen from the side could not be
distinguished from a trotter except by an expert,
but poor old Birmingham Joe was labouring along
like a channel boat in a south-wester, and his
hobbles were singing from the strain like an
æolian harp.  It was this strain, and the fact
that poor old Birmingham Joe's master had
<i>everything</i> old (including the horse), which won
Gay the race.
</p>

<p>
The sulky was an old heavy metal one, made
in England years ago, the hobbles had been
patched and mended till little of the original
hobbles remained, and as the two horses came
neck and neck (Gay on the outside) round the
last turn, the æolian sound of the hobbles
changed to a sudden rending crash, and old
Birmingham Joe turned a complete somersault,
pitching his driver over his head, and landing on
top of him, the hobbles having broken.
</p>

<p>
Gay jogged in a winner in 3.35, a second faster
than her horse had ever trotted before, and
whilst the driver of Birmingham Joe was carried
in on a stretcher with a broken leg, Mackrell
finished on a canter last of all, amidst the yells of
his backers, that alternated with loud cheers for
Gay Lawless.
</p>

<p>
In these cheers neither Lossie nor the
Professor joined.  They had not understood what
Rensslaer meant when he had suddenly appeared
beside them, and hurried Gay away.  They had
hardly understood what it meant when after a
considerable delay (for they were at some distance
from the stables) they had seen a woman's shape
in a Faber, driving rapidly towards the track,
and when in the first round Gay had swept by
close to them, looking extraordinarily pretty and
determined, her little feet planted firmly on the
rail before her, eyes wide with excitement and
courage, the Professor had all but fallen down
in a fit, while Lossie rejoiced&mdash;even Carlton
Mackrell's affection could hardly survive that.
</p>

<p>
On all sides kodaks had flashed; indeed in
the event, nearly every illustrated paper made a
scandalous feature of a sight common enough
in Vienna.  Min Toplady alone of the women
clapped her hands, and cheered at the top of her
voice; but the excitement now over, Gay herself
felt shaky, and more than half inclined to burst
into tears.
</p>

<p>
Even the presentation to her of the Gold Vase
was by no means the ecstacy she had expected.
It was by a desperate effort that she held her
head up, spoke her thanks, smiled, and marched
away with Rensslaer, who tucked the Vase under
his arm as if used to such ridiculous impedimenta,
and took her straight to her brother, followed by
the cheers of the lookers-on, in which a nice ear
might detect a certain note of familiarity.  Possibly
she detected it, but was quite unaware that
Carlton was about having a very bad quarter of an
hour, called as he had been before the Stewards,
for an explanation of his extraordinary driving.
</p>

<p>
He declared that his horse lost a toe weight at
the first turn, which caused him to break, and he
could not, or would not settle afterwards, and
when the horse was examined, it was seen that
the near toe weight was missing.
</p>

<p>
While the discussion was still going on, one of
the distance judges brought in the toe weight, and
also the screw which held it, but instead of the
screw being broken, or the threads worn, it was
seen that the screw had only a head, and very
short shank, and that the latter showed marks
of its having quite recently had the end of the
screw shank filed off, so that there was only a
head, and a little bit of shank.
</p>

<p>
The blacksmith who was employed at the
trotting track said that Mackrell borrowed a file
of him before the final heat, and being curious as
to what he wanted it for, he followed him at a
distance, and saw him filing something behind a
tree, after which he went to screw on his horse's
toe weights.
</p>

<p>
The blacksmith went behind the tree and
picked up the half of a screw (the point end),
which he produced, and it corresponded to the
screw which Mac's horse had lost with his toe
weight.
</p>

<p>
Result&mdash;expelled from ever driving in the
Clubhouse, and outlawed forever.
</p>

<p>
Mackrell bowed, and withdrew with perfect
<i>sang-froid</i>.  He had pulled off what he intended,
and if Gay had been made happy by getting
what she wanted, he did not in the least grudge
the price he had paid.  But when he joined, or
rather intercepted, her on the way to the gates,
he found a pale, almost tearful Gay, and one
glance at the Professor's and Lossie's faces
convinced him that they had been baiting her
cruelly, in spite of Rensslaer, who cool and
imperturbable as ever, walked beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Hearty congratulations, Gay!" Mackrell
cried, taking her hand.  "It was the best done,
pluckiest thing I ever saw in my life, and the
Gold Vase is yours."
</p>

<p>
Gay controlled her voice to thank him, but
Rensslaer shot a quick glance at the other's
face&mdash;he had, of course, seen Mackrell's game from
the first, and was also aware of that summons to
the Stewards' room, to which there could only be
one issue.
</p>

<p>
"I am astonished," said the Professor in
quavery tones, "astonished and shocked at your
congratulating my sister on the disgraceful,
unwomanly exhibition she has just made of
herself, and for which I am to blame, in not
having put my foot down on this degrading sport
from the first."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! put it down," said Carlton, who looked
very handsome and determined, "and keep it
there if you like.  <i>I'm</i> going to take Gay home,
and the quieter she is kept the better"&mdash;he
turned on Lossie Holden a glance beneath which
she quailed&mdash;"so you can travel back as you
came, with the Professor."
</p>

<p>
He put Gay as he spoke into a waiting
carriage, seated himself beside her, and drove off,
Rensslaer having handed to Gay her coveted
trophy.
</p>

<p>
"I believe," said the Professor, "that the
indecency on wheels in which my unfortunate sister
drove was your property, Mr. Rensslaer, and as
she could not possibly have used it without your
consent, I imagine it was at your suggestion she
did so."
</p>

<p>
"You're right there," said Rensslaer encouragingly,
"and I'm proud to know my Faber's been
of use to the nicest, pluckiest girl, bar none, I've
seen in England."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," cried the Professor, trembling
with rage, "I shall make it my business to see
that she has no opportunity of disgracing herself
and me again," and seizing Lossie's arm, he
hurried her away.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
TWO LOVERS
</h3>

<p>
If God sends friends, the devil sends collaterals,
for the former, in addition to their superior good
qualities, at least have the civility to knock at
your door, the latter walk straight in to torment
you at their pleasure, and Carlton had hardly left
the house when Lossie appeared, furious at the
determined way he had carried Gay off, and more
furious still at the rebuke he had administered to
herself.
</p>

<p>
"You've done it now, Gay," she said spitefully.
"Frank's raving mad&mdash;how I got him to town, I
don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Let him rave," said Gay coolly, holding one
little foot to the fire.  Her eyes still sparkled, a
lovely colour was in her cheeks, on a table near
glittered the coveted Gold Vase, and though her
arms ached horribly from the late strain on them,
she cared no more for the ache than for Lossie's
acrimonious reproaches.
</p>

<p>
"Toes turned out, first position," said
Lossie, watching Gay's face cruelly.  "It
was something to be thankful for, I suppose,
that your feet weren't further apart than they
were!"
</p>

<p>
Gay flushed.
</p>

<p>
She had thought only of bracing her toes hard
against the foot-rests, not at all of how they
looked.  <i>Had</i> she looked immodest after all?
</p>

<p>
"Lucky you had no feathers in your hat,"
said Lossie with a sneer, and at that injustice
to her invariably neat racing garb, Gay rebelled
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Did you <i>ever</i> see me befeathered on a
race-course?" she said contemptuously, but Lossie
shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It looks as if you'd dressed for the part, and
went down with the full intention of playing it,"
she said.  "That rug, too, outlining you like a
sheath&mdash;<i>that</i> was ready also, strange to say!"
</p>

<p>
"It was Mr. Rensslaer's," said Gay.  "I
suppose it was <i>my</i> fault that my driver got
drunk, and someone had to be found at the
last moment to take his place?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rensslaer could have taken it, and
would have done, if you'd let him&mdash;"  And
as this was true, Gay had no answer ready on
that point.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, I won it," she said, and tossed her
pretty head, "that's the main thing."
</p>

<p>
"Because Carlton Mackrell let you," said
Lossie.  "Didn't you hear the crowd howling
at him when he gave you the inside place?  Or
so a man told me who was watching the race
through his glasses.  Hark!"
</p>

<p>
Through the window came the yell of a
newsboy in the street:
</p>

<p>
"Well-known owner of Trotters expelled for
unfair driving at Waterloo Park to-day!"
</p>

<p>
Lossie ran out of the room and downstairs,
while Gay, her heart beating wildly, and very
pale, felt her triumph turned to sawdust between
her teeth.
</p>

<p>
Carlton's horse was a far better one than
hers ... Rensslaer had told her so ... he
knew how to drive, she did not.
</p>

<p>
"Here it is," cried Lossie, returning.  Unfolding
the sheet at the latest news, she read
aloud a brief paragraph announcing that
Mr. Carlton Mackrell had been expelled from the
Clubhouse, and barred from ever driving again, for
tampering with his horse's toe weights in the race
for the Gold Vase, won by Miss Gay Lawless.
</p>

<p>
And he had not said one word to her of this.
Oh! what had she done?  For a whim, and in
pure hot-headedness, she had taken up a sport
suitable for men only, made herself notorious,
inflicted pain on her brother and Chris, and,
finally, made a man who loved her submit to
disgrace, and deprivation of his favourite amusement,
rather than she should be disappointed of a
silly Gold Vase!  Did Rensslaer know&mdash;had he
<i>seen</i> it, and made no sign?
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mackrell!" she said, then dried her
tears, as she would not have done had he or
Chris, or Rensslaer been present.  At that
moment the distracted Professor came into the
room, and Gay, with an impulse of pity, went up,
and laid her hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"My driver was drunk, Frank," she said,
"and it had to be decided all in a moment.  It
didn't seem to me wrong at all then&mdash;and even
now I'm not sure that it was&mdash;it's Carlton
Mackrell I'm worrying about&mdash;" then went
away, and locked herself into her room.
</p>

<p>
She was very quiet when she got there, poor
Gay, sitting on the side of her bed, with all the
triumph of a few hours ago fizzled out.  A debt
of honour came before all others, and this was
one of them....  Gay's heart was generous
enough to realise that surely Carlton had never
meant her to know, never meant to be found out,
but he had bungled at his tricky work, as honest
men will, and he meant her to have that Gold
Vase, and she had got it&mdash;for what it was worth.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the ugly, the sordid side of this sport
she had taken up so recklessly, showed to Gay.
She seemed to see the man carried away with his
broken leg&mdash;yes, there were accidents at Trotting
as well as at Chris's game&mdash;and the clamorous
desire to win something, money or a bit of plate,
or the success that is notoriety, took on its true
colours&mdash;something loud, common, of no value to
a woman of taste, whose true kingdom was her
home.
</p>

<p>
She had all along fought her love for Chris
because of the danger, the unhealthy excitement
of his life, and deliberately she had emulated it,
and was now tasting the bitter fruit of disillusionment,
of disgust.  It struck her then, as it has
done so many others, that it is doing the things
that we want to do, not those that we ought, that
we mostly come to our ruin.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
Chris Hannen, speeding slowly towards a
perfect recovery, had succeeded in turning out
his nurses, and Mrs. Summers, to her great joy,
was now his sole attendant.  Promoted to a sofa,
he had opened eagerly the last evening special to
see if Gay had won the Gold Vase, only to be
confronted with a piquante description of her as
she had appeared when seated in the Faber,
looking as a man would prefer almost any other
woman than his sweetheart or sister to look, as
she steered her horse to victory.
</p>

<p>
He winced as he read, and when he came to
Carlton Mackrell's summary expulsion, and the
reason, his heart sank, for now Gay would
consider herself bound in honour to reward the
man who had not hesitated to disgrace himself, so
that she might possess the toy after which she
had so often hankered in his hearing.
</p>

<p>
Chris had always hated Gay's going in for
Trotting, and yet, was he himself any better&mdash;risking
his life for excitement, wringing Gay's
heart?  Why not be a <i>sportsman</i>?&mdash;ride for
pleasure, not gain, though to be sure it was
pleasure, and to spare to him!
</p>

<p>
"Serves Mackrell jolly well right for being
kicked out," he growled, and did not pity him a
bit&mdash;but Gay would, and there was the rub.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer, too, had behaved badly.  He was a
much older man; he was under no illusions as to
the status of the sport in England, yet he
accompanied her to meetings&mdash;would probably go on
doing so now that Mackrell was barred from the
Trotting course.
</p>

<p>
Chris's meditations made him so feverish, and
brought out such a hectic flush on his cheeks,
that Mrs. Summers was seriously alarmed when
presently she arranged his dinner on the invalid
table slung before him.  But looking shrewdly
about for the cause, she caught sight of the paper
on his knee, and though they had never exchanged
a word on the subject, Mrs. Summers knew well
enough what place Gay held in his heart, and
that the young lady was racing her horse for the
Gold Vase that day.
</p>

<p>
"Has Miss Gay won, Mr. Chris?" she inquired,
and he nodded, but did not pursue the subject.
Evidently, he thought, Gay had been carried
away by audacity and high spirits, for of course
he did not know of the driver's mistimed
conviviality that had given the girl her longed-for
opportunity.  And now they were baiting her,
no doubt, that spiteful Lossie, and the hysterical
Professor, and he not able to stand by her&mdash;she
wanted someone badly...
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two he racked his brains, then
suddenly remembered Min Toplady, and leaving
his dinner untouched, he turned to the telephone
within reach, and picking up the book, found to
his great relief her husband's number.
</p>

<p>
He was lucky enough to get on quickly, and
to his "Are you there?" it was Min's cheery
voice that responded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;it's Chris Hannen.  I want you to go
at once to Miss Gay, she has had a trying
day&mdash;no, you needn't say I sent you&mdash;only that
you wanted to congratulate her on her success&mdash;you
will go?  Thanks&mdash;yes&mdash;she did it splendidly,
you say?  Never saw anything prettier?  Rotten
shame about Mr. Mackrell&mdash;something must be
done&mdash;yes&mdash;you're going at once&mdash;good&mdash;'phone
me to-night how she is, if possible&mdash;yes&mdash;good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He replaced the receiver, and returned to his
half-cold dinner with more appetite than he had
begun it.  Min Toplady was a doughty champion,
capable of routing Lossie or the Professor with
great slaughter, and Chris grinned to himself
as he imagined the passages-at-arms likely to
occur.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Gay would not stand alone, and with
her own courage, and such a powerful backer,
ought to pull through with honour.
</p>

<p>
His spirits rose.  Mrs. Summers, coming and
going, was delighted to find him in such good
fettle; she thought Miss Gay's success in winning
the Gold Vase had something to do with it, and
though privately a little shocked at the young
lady's sporting tastes, she was glad of anything
that did her young master good.
</p>

<p>
But when she had left him, with his cigarette-case
at his elbow, he got restless again; the
quiet room, in which he had lived so much lately,
got on his nerves, and a profound depression
stole over him.  He longed for someone to talk
with; if he had not been such a confounded way
from town, he would have called up one of his
club friends, and got from him the popular
opinion of the day's events at Waterloo Park.
</p>

<p>
Most of all, he would have liked to see Carlton
Mackrell, and as if the thought had summoned
him, the door quietly opened, and that gentleman,
announced by Mrs. Summers, walked into the room.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
MIN TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
"The very man I wanted to see," cried Chris
as they shook hands.  "You'll have some
dinner?  Mrs. Summers won't keep you waiting
long."
</p>

<p>
Mackrell shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I had all I want in town," he said, sitting
down opposite Chris.  He look tired and ill;
it is always easier for a dark man to look out
of sorts than a fair one, and in spite of all that
he had lately suffered, Chris had the advantage
of the other at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"It's a rotten game, Trotting," said Carlton
abruptly, "and I'm more than sorry I ever
encouraged Miss Gay to go in for it.  But she
has won her Gold Vase, and now I hope she'll
chuck the whole thing, especially"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"as I'm chucked."
</p>

<p>
Chris looked into the fire,
</p>

<p>
"When you think of the practices that go
on at the game," said Mackrell, "how a man
will win a race with a certain horse, then fake
him, change his name, and enter him for another
race under a different name, and that the
Stewards spend half their time investigating
'shady cases,' it's almost an honour to be fired
out&mdash;at least, I know Rensslaer would think so."
</p>

<p>
Chris was still silent, staring into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you speak, man?" cried Mackrell
irritably.
</p>

<p>
"You have laid Miss Gay under an obligation,"
said Chris quietly.  "She is the soul of honour&mdash;as
you well know&mdash;and she will pay it to the
last penny.  She gets her Gold Vase&mdash;yes,
but you have played to get what is worth a
million gold vases&mdash;herself."
</p>

<p>
Mackrell uttered an exclamation of anger
and half rose, but Chris went on unmoved with
what he had to say.
</p>

<p>
"Has it struck you that we are both rotters&mdash;both
utterly selfish in our aims and pursuits&mdash;that
neither of us is good enough for that dear
little girl&mdash;that Rensslaer is a far finer sportsman,
and better all-round man than either of us?  He
is doing real good with his breeding stables,
and improvement of the breed of horses&mdash;he
pursues a definite aim that the State should be
grateful for&mdash;that <i>is</i> appreciated by almost every
country but England&mdash;but what good are you
and I doing?  Miss Gay hates my profession
as jockey&mdash;its danger, its excitement, its more
or less unhealthy surroundings&mdash;yet I persist
in following it, and when I come to grief, inflict
pain on her....  And you, Mackrell, who lightly
infect her with your own love for Trotting, who
are mainly responsible for her taking up a rôle that
few men would permit in a sister, are you much
better than I am?  You wanted her company,
and you got it&mdash;and, as usual, it's the woman
who has to pay."
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, man," burst out Mackrell fiercely,
"you make me out a scoundrel, who offers a
farthing doll as a bribe to get possession of a
great treasure, but you're wrong, utterly wrong.
Unless Miss Gay sends for me, I shall not go
near her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And she will send," said Chris grimly.  Too
late he now remembered that Min Toplady was
with Carlton's suit heart and soul, and much
too clever not to make ample use to-night of
the opportunity given her by the day's events.
</p>

<p>
Mackrell looked up, his face suddenly grown
old and lined.
</p>

<p>
"I came to you for bread, and you've given
me a stone," he said.  "You make it impossible
for me to ask Miss Gay to be my wife&mdash;and you
know it."
</p>

<p>
"I think you did wrong to cheat, so that she
might win what was practically valueless," said
Chris quietly.  "I repeat that you had no right
to lay her under such an enormous obligation."
</p>

<p>
"I did not expect to be bowled out," said
Mackrell sullenly.  "Her dearest wish was to
win the Vase&mdash;it was my earnest desire that she
should do so&mdash;my thoughts went no further than
that.  If that infernal chap hadn't followed me,
Miss Gay would have believed she had won on
her horse's merits, for you may be sure I should
never have undeceived her."
</p>

<p>
Chris silently held out his hand, and Mackrell,
after a moment's hesitation, took it.
</p>

<p>
"Can nothing be done?" said Chris.  "It's
preposterous that you are to be made an example
of like this!  Have you seen Rensslaer?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I took Gay back to town&mdash;of course
she did not know about me.  Heavens!  I expect
they're tearing her to pieces at Connaught
Square.  It's on her account I'm here&mdash;I
thought she might have 'phoned to you&mdash;told
you how she was."
</p>

<p>
"No, but I expect to hear presently.  I've
sent Min Toplady to her."
</p>

<p>
"Good old Min!" exclaimed Mackrell.  "I'm
sorry for anyone who attempts to bully Miss
Gay in <i>her</i> presence."
</p>

<p>
Chris laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Have a drink, old man, and buck up," he
said.  "Unless I'm much mistaken, Miss Gay
drove her first and last race to-day, and her
horses will be "scratched" without delay.  It
wouldn't trouble me much if mine were," he
added gloomily, "for I have no luck."
</p>

<p>
The telephone bell rang.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;are you there?  It's all right,
Mr. Chris, Miss Lossie is gone&mdash;I've rated the
Professor, and put Miss Gay to bed.  There's
been a lot of fur and feathers flying ... <i>that</i> Miss
Lossie.  I 'phoned Mr. Mackrell at his club,
but he wasn't there.  Miss Gay wanted him
to call to-morrow morning first thing after
breakfast&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here," said Chris, and held out the receiver
to Carlton.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it's you, Mr. Mackrell, that's all right&mdash;yes,
I'll 'phone Miss Gay in the morning that
you're coming.  What ... you can't ... you're
going to Paris!  Miss Gay sent her love to
Mr. Chris.  Good-night."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
Gay had made no reply to the frequent and
irritating knocks on her door, but soon after eight
had struck, a welcome voice issuing from the
keyhole made her jump up, and promptly turn
the key.
</p>

<p>
"My lamb," cried Min Toplady, folding her
in a motherly embrace, and Gay, clinging to her,
cried her heart out, and was comforted and
made comfortable, and presently, with the blinds
pulled down, a wood fire lit, and a dinner tray
placed before her that the cook had carefully
prepared, Gay was able to laugh at herself, and
even enjoy Min's unconcealed delight at the
brilliant style in which she had won her race
that day.
</p>

<p>
"Never saw you more bewitching," cried Min,
"and the dress and attitude were modest enough,
it was only the idea of the thing, that prudes
might call indelicate.  Toplady says all the men
were wild about you, for of course they knew about
your driver being squiffy, and thought it the
gamest thing out, your driving yourself.  Of
course," added Min, "your horse wasn't half
good enough for you, my dear, or even as good
as Mr. Carlton's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Min!" cried Gay, "Mr. Mackrell has
ruined himself that I might win that wretched
Gold Vase!"
</p>

<p>
"Stuff and nonsense!" said Min stoutly.  "His
toe weights were all right, and as to what that
rascal swore to, there's not a word of truth in it.
Why, one of that lot would sell his own soul for
a shilling, and tell any lie for sixpence.  Not
but what he wanted you to win, Miss Gay, for
he worships every hair of your head, but he was
getting tired of the game, and ain't sorry to quit
it.  And, my lamb," went on Min tenderly,
"you've had your bit of fun, and you've won
what you wanted, and if I were you I'd leave it
at that, now Mr. Mackrell won't be here to make
things pleasant for you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Min," cried Gay sadly, "you also!
Everyone is against me&mdash;even Mr. Hannen.
He must have seen the papers to-night&mdash;what
<i>will</i> he say?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Mr. Chris who asked me to come up
and see you," said Min reluctantly, for Carlton
Mackrell's chances with Gay had never seemed
to her better than now, if he only followed them
up quickly.
</p>

<p>
Tears sprang to Gay's eyes at this evidence of
Chris's thought for her, and an intense longing to
see, and speak with him, seized her.  She had
begged the Professor to take her on one of his
frequent visits to Epsom, but he had always
refused, very unkindly, as Gay thought.
</p>

<p>
"Did he think I was in trouble, then?" she
said, and blushed.
</p>

<p>
"He knew Mr. Mackrell's being warned off
would upset you, I expect," said Min, "also," she
added with a sniff, "he may have thought Mr. Frank
and <i>that</i> Miss Lossie would be getting at
you, and you wanted protection."
</p>

<p>
At that moment a knock came at the door, and
a servant appeared with a message from the
Professor, requesting Mrs. Toplady to give him
a few minutes' conversation in his study.  With
an ominous flounce, and toss of the head, but a
reassuring squeeze of the hand to Gay, Min
descended, full of fight, to find, as she expected,
Lossie lounging by the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Mr. Frank," said Min
beamingly.  "I'm paying you a return visit,
you see.  Hope you got home all right that time?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor squirmed, and pushed forward a
chair, upon which Min settled her ample person,
then, affecting to see Lossie for the first time,
remarked in a tone of lofty rebuke:
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't sit moping so near the fire,
Miss Holden&mdash;it makes your nose red&mdash;for you're
no chicken, and it's sinful to spoil your chances
of a husband like that!  Now Miss Gay, with
her outdoor life and sports, will never grow old,
or want for lovers, bless her!"
</p>

<p>
"It's just about these sports that I wanted to
speak to you, Min," said the Professor with
nervous haste.  "The&mdash;ah&mdash;shocking exhibition
my sister made of herself to-day&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful driving for a beginner&mdash;won-der-ful!"
said Min admiringly.  "Did you ever hear
such cheering?  Trotting 'ud soon look up if you
could get half-a-dozen Miss Gays to drive their
own horses."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe that out of all England you'd
find one other such immodest girl as my cousin,"
said Lossie, "or one family that would permit her
to do what she did to-day."
</p>

<p>
"How could I stop her?" cried the Professor
irascibly.  "I nearly had a fit when she appeared
on the track."
</p>

<p>
"You could have stopped it at the beginning,"
said Lossie sharply, "before she had ruined
Carlton Mackrell's career, and made of herself a
public scandal."
</p>

<p>
"It must be a comfort to you, Miss Lossie,"
said Min silkily, "that <i>you</i> hadn't enough
influence with Mr. Mackrell to make him do
anything wrong.  He just worships Miss Gay,
and when he found she had set her heart on the
Gold Vase, why, he took care that she should
get it, like the true lover that he is!"
</p>

<p>
"This woman has always been a bad influence
with Gay," Lossie said furiously to Frank, "and
they make a combination that will be too strong
for you, if you don't look out."
</p>

<p>
"I came here to talk to Mr. Frank, not you,"
said Min equably.  "My motto is, 'let every tub
stand on its own bottom,' and if I were you, I'd
try and get some beaux of my own, and not be
always grabbing at Miss Gay's."
</p>

<p>
"Insolent woman!" cried Lossie, with flashing
eyes, but Min merely nodded in a maddening
way, and said:
</p>

<p>
"You always hated Miss Gay because all the
men loved her&mdash;what one man likes, the rest
mostly do, and perhaps if you could have got
hold of <i>one</i>, Miss Lossie, others might have come
along too.  At present it looks as if you'll have
to put up with poor Mr. Frank after all, for you
can't live without plenty of money!"
</p>

<p>
Having produced her effect, if the Professor's
terror-struck face were to be trusted, Min
proceeded to the discussion of the matter really
in hand.
</p>

<p>
"You want Miss Gay to give up Trotting,"
she said, addressing Frank quietly, "and now
she hasn't Mr. Mackrell to help her, I think
perhaps she'll be willing.  But if you bully her,
Mr. Frank, she'll go on with it just to defy you,
for Miss Gay has got a temper and a will of her
own, for all that she's the sweetest, and best, and
prettiest little lady in the world."
</p>

<p>
"What do you advise?" said the Professor
quaveringly, for Min's reckless unveiling of
Lossie's secret intentions towards himself (failing
anyone else) had half-frightened him out of his
senses.
</p>

<p>
"I advise you to let her alone, Mr. Frank,"
said Min, "and make that poke-nose"&mdash;she
pointed an accusing finger at Lossie&mdash;"stop at
home, and not come here meddling and
interfering, for if Miss Gay wants advice,
Mr. Rensslaer'll be the one to give it, and settle
what's to be done about her horses.  And now,
Mr. Frank, I'll say good-night, as I'm going to
put my lamb to bed, and if you want me at any
time, why, you know where to find me, and any
hospitality Toplady and me can show you, (one
eye closed in an almost imperceptible wink) we'll
be proud and happy, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Min," said Frank hurriedly, as he
opened the door for her to go upstairs, then
skipping out with her, closed it behind him&mdash;and ran.
</p>

<p>
Min stood, shaking with laughter, as in the
distance she heard the laboratory door shut, and
the key turned.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
"FIGHTING" GAY
</h3>

<p>
Those who thought they knew their Gay, and
that she was humbled, penitent, and willing to
amend her "trotting" ways, speedily found
themselves mistaken on this point, and the first to
whom she gave a taste of her quality was the
unhappy Professor, who entered the breakfast-room
next day, gibbering, and extending towards
her an illustrated morning paper.
</p>

<p>
Gay took it calmly from his hand, but a flush
of anger rose to her cheek as she saw that, whether
from spite or ignorance, the artist had maliciously
altered the position of her feet, a pose
emphasised by the devil-may-care look in the
pretty, saucy face turned impudently over her
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody who doesn't like me, evidently,"
said Gay, sitting down at the head of the table,
and commencing to pour out coffee.  "Wonder
if it's anyone Lossie knows?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardened!  Shameless!" sputtered the Professor,
walking to and fro and wringing his hands.
Gay felt glad Chris was not there, as he used to
get behind the Professor, and wring <i>his</i> in
imitation, convulsing her.
</p>

<p>
"I insist on it," cried her brother, "that you
wire your trainer instantly to 'scratch'&mdash;I
believe that is the expression&mdash;your horses for
all future meetings, and I will take you abroad
till this shocking scandal is forgotten.  Why,
even there, we shan't be safe, for you will be
lampooned on the boulevards&mdash;an English lady
driving like a stable-boy&mdash;in a man's attitude"&mdash;his
voice rose to a shriek as Gay walked to the
chafing-dishes on the sideboard, and helped
herself to bacon.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't wonder if I get mentioned as a
'horrible example' from a pulpit or two," she
said placidly, "and probably there will be several
fancy sketches of me driving <i>really</i> like a boy&mdash;in
one of those old-fashioned sulkies where you
can't even see your horse's head, and have to
guide him by faith and a double squint.  Have
some kidneys, Heron?  They're awfully good."
</p>

<p>
But the angry Professor waved away the
proffered delicacy, and resumed his wind-mill
antics up and down the room, thereby getting
on Gay's nerves.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Heron," she said quietly, "it
may save trouble if you will just grasp the fact
that my horses will not be withdrawn, that their
engagements <i>will</i> be fulfilled, and that I shall be
present at <i>all</i> the meetings, and if you don't
care to chaperon me, I'll find someone who will."
</p>

<p>
"Lossie won't!" screamed the Professor, now
almost beside himself at this flat rebellion, "nor
Mrs. Bulteel either!  You've never been able to
persuade her to set foot on a Trotting course&mdash;even
if she were willing, Tom Bulteel wouldn't
let her!"
</p>

<p>
It was true, and Gay thought it horrid of Effie;
then her soft little face hardened, and she shot
her bolt.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll go under Min Toplady's protection,"
she said.  "I can make her do anything I like&mdash;and
<i>she</i> shall take me&mdash;and jolly good times we
shall have, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cried the Professor, "my sister&mdash;my
<i>sister</i> going to Meetings with public-house
ladies in public-house traps"&mdash;he forgot that he
had once censured Lossie for thus speaking of
Gay's old nurse.
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"I shall stay at the 'Trotting Nag' altogether,
if you're going on as you are now," she said.
"Lossie can come and keep house for you&mdash;no
one could say anything on the score of propriety,
you know," she added, with as much malice
as her sweet temper permitted, "for she is a
relation!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor shuddered.  He had not yet
got over the shock Min Toplady's remarks about
Lossie had given him overnight.  What would
become of his specimens, his microscopic work,
of <i>him</i>, if pitchforked into matrimony?
</p>

<p>
Lossie was a deuced pretty woman, of course,
but she had a horrid temper, and original as Gay
was, his natural selfishness, and sure male instinct,
told him he was safer with the latter than the
former.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," he said, and sat down dejectedly.
"A wilful man will have his way, they say, and
now that my feminine little sister has taken up
with a man's life and sports, I suppose she'll,
like him, have <i>her</i> way, no matter who pays."
</p>

<p>
"Heron!" exclaimed Gay, suddenly contrite,
and got up, and went round to him.  For a
moment she did not speak, and it struck her
that she had shed more tears, felt more "sloppy,"
since she started Trotting, than in all the years
of her life before&mdash;yes, and apparently done more
mischief to others.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see, Frank, that if I don't face the
music, if I seem ashamed of all this hateful
publicity&mdash;for it <i>is</i> hateful&mdash;I shall only be a
coward, and make things worse?  I don't
promise that I'll give up Trotting, but probably
I may&mdash;with poor Carlton warned off, I don't
expect to take much pleasure in it again.  And
now, Frank"&mdash;she kissed him, and smoothed his
hair&mdash;"you've got to eat your breakfast, and
forget about all this for the present."
</p>

<p>
She helped him to kidneys, and rang, for fresh
coffee.  Presently, comforted against his will,
Frank stole a glance at Gay, who seemed deep
in thought, and indeed with one lover outlawed
from his favourite sport, and the other absent,
prevented for the time being, from following a
dangerous profession that Gay hated, she felt at
that moment very friendless indeed.
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Rensslaer would only weigh in, and
race Trotters himself, she thought, but he
wouldn't, and then she got up, fetched her little
basket of keys, and waving her hand to Heron,
set out on her usual morning tour of housekeeping.
</p>

<p>
The Professor waited till she had gone, then
deliberately kicked the offending newspaper round
the room (all men of science are childish), and
departed, well-pleased with himself, to his study.
Inflating his pigeon-chest, he said to himself
that Gay was a dear little thing, if misguided&mdash;and
after all she had <i>him</i> to stand by her.  The
escapade of yesterday would probably do no
more than make a nine days' talk, then blow
over, and when she married Chris, as the
Professor had always felt sure she intended to do
ultimately, she would be just a domesticated girl,
with all this racing rubbish knocked clean out of
her head.
</p>

<p>
At eleven o'clock, Rensslaer was announced,
and Gay rose eagerly to meet him, for he might
be able to give her news of Carlton, from whom
she had heard nothing, and she put the question
without loss of time.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rensslaer, "it struck me as
ironic that one of the few men who had conferred
distinction on the sport of Trotting in England,
should be expelled the Club, when so many
undesirables remain to disgrace it, so I looked in
at St. James's Place just now to tell him so."
</p>

<p>
Gay opened her lips to ask how he looked, then
checked herself, but in reality Carlton was not in
the least disgraced.  Everyone knew how he
had lost a race purposely that a pretty girl might
win it, but he <i>did</i> blame himself for encouraging
Gay in her fad, and still more for the weakness
that had at all costs determined her girlish
wish for the Gold Vase should be gratified.
</p>

<p>
He had done her as ill a turn as a man can
do the woman he loves, but he felt justly, that
Rensslaer was to blame for the scandal of Gay's
driving herself, that the latter should have
dissuaded her, and taken Brusher's place, and
had not hesitated to tell him so when he
appeared.
</p>

<p>
"We had a talk over his plans for the future,"
said Rensslaer, "and I strongly advised him to
race his horses in Vienna and Paris, and offered
him every assistance should he decide to do so.
But he didn't seem keen on it&mdash;promised to think
it over, and let me know.  Said he was taking a
short run abroad for the present&mdash;would probably
do a cure at Aix."
</p>

<p>
A look of keen relief crossed Gay's face, and
at that moment a servant entered with an
express letter.  While Gay, asking permission from
Rensslaer, read it, he thought how almost
incredible was the amount of wicked, even
dishonest, things that a dear, pretty little girl,
honest as the day, could make a man do, and
how ungrateful she could prove herself for his
doing them.
</p>

<p>
"Will she feel bound to reward him, I wonder?
Will he expect it?" he thought.
</p>

<p>
Yet with William Blake, Rensslaer knew that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He who bends to himself a joy,<br>
  Does the wingéd life destroy,<br>
  But he who kisses the joy as it flies<br>
  Lives in eternity's sunrise."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"For it's that Hannen boy she loves, and
he her.  I've watched her face&mdash;still, as he
won't promise not to steeplechase, and she won't
marry him if he doesn't, I don't see what's going
to happen."
</p>

<p>
"You're quite right," she said, "Mr. Mackrell
is off to-day, and will not have time to call here
before he starts.  I told my brother this morning
that my horses will keep the engagements for
which they are entered, but after that&mdash;"  She
hesitated, and looked at him anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"After that, Miss Gay," he said gravely,
"don't enter them for any more.  It's not a
woman's game&mdash;at least, for one so womanly as
you are&mdash;and you'll never do any good at it over
here."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't those snapshots and sketches of me
horrible?" said Gay in a whisper.  "I'm looking
forward with terror to the illustrated weeklies."
</p>

<p>
"It was a plucky idea, pluckily carried out,"
he said, "though Mackrell didn't mince his words
to me just now&mdash;told me I ought to have
prevented you and done the driving myself.
But I don't think"&mdash;he smiled whimsically&mdash;"anything
short of <i>force majeure</i> would have
stopped you."
</p>

<p>
"Not even the devil," cried Gay, with sparkling
eyes.  "I sin with my eyes wide open, and I'd
do it again this very minute."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" he said equably.  "As I said
before, you must come over and drive for me in
Vienna.  I have won so many prizes there," he
added quaintly, "that they don't like me to
compete any more.  Let me know the dates of
any Meetings you have to attend, and no matter
how far away I may be, I'll come back to escort
you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she cried, impulsively holding
out both hands, and as he took them, the door
opened, and Effie Bulteel came in.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone, and he went immediately,
Effie flung her arms round Gay, and gave her a
good hug.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what Tom says, or how those
horrid papers lampoon you," she cried, "it was
awfully game of you, and I'd have loved to do it
myself!"
</p>

<p>
"You're a trump!" cried Gay.  "You see,
the driver was tight, and I <i>longed</i> to do it, so
when the opportunity came, I was like the
teetotaler who joined the Blue Ribbon Army,
because he thought it must be so delicious to be
tempted&mdash;and to <i>fall</i>&mdash;and I fell!"
</p>

<p>
Effie laughed heartily, then exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Poor Carlton!  But what a fool to be caught
like that!  Gay, if ever you want a thing done
properly, get a knave to do it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I <i>didn't</i> want," cried Gay, "and as to
that Gold Vase, it may be turned into a coal vase
for all I care.  He&mdash;he is going abroad at
once&mdash;he has written to tell me so."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Reculer pour mieux sauter</i>," said Effie
significantly.  "Awfully good form of him, though,
to clear out just now, instead of appearing like a
tradesman with his bill made out, waiting for it to
be paid, and a receipt given!  And Chris out of
the running, too!  Poor Gay!  You'll have to
take the Trotting man after all."
</p>

<p>
"Only, even if I wished it, he won't take me,"
said Gay, and laughed at the epithet&mdash;Effie, like
others, was still possessed of the entirely mistaken
idea that Trotting was the be-all and end-all of
Rensslaer's life, when in fact it was only one, and
that by no means the greatest, of his hobbies.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in platonics, you know," said
Effie drily, "and I intruded on quite an affecting
little tableau just now.  But now, Gay, what are
you going to do?  Tom says, of course, you'll
drop it&mdash;the Trotting, I mean&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I'd die sooner!" cried Gay, with flashing
eyes.  "Effie, if you've come here only to tell me
that, then you are no real pal of mine.  The least
you can do is to stand by me, you and Tom&mdash;I
can't attend the race Meetings alone, or with
Lossie, who has been perfectly hateful to me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Effie sympathetically, "she would,
you know!"
</p>

<p>
"And Frank simply won't&mdash;besides, I don't
want to be regarded as keeper to a lunatic.  Failing
you and Tom, I'll have to attend the meetings
with Rensslaer or Min Toplady&mdash;or both!  We
don't want our friends when we are in the right,
but to dig us out of holes that our own folly has
let us into&mdash;though in spite of everything I'm
glad, <i>glad</i> I drove yesterday!"
</p>

<p>
"It's true I have some influence over Tom,"
said Effie thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Boundless," murmured Gay.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't think it goes far enough to make
him attend, or consent to my appearing at, a
Trotting Meeting.  I believe he's really glad
Carlton's warned off&mdash;a sort of being saved from
the evil to come, you know."
</p>

<p>
"If the man I married, refused to perform an
act of Christian charity for my greatest friend,
I'd know the reason why, that's all," said Gay
curtly.
</p>

<p>
Effie gasped.  This was a new Gay, with
whom she did not know how to reckon&mdash;evidently
Trotting was spoiling her sweet
temper....
</p>

<p>
"But is it charity?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you say just now how you'd have liked
to do what I did?" cried Gay in a rage, "and
now you're jibbing at the consequences!  I don't&mdash;I
face them.  And it's just a piece of snobbishness
for Tom to turn up his nose at what is good
enough for Rensslaer, and the very pick of
American sportsmen!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, everywhere but in England," said Effie
absently.
</p>

<p>
Gay's jibes had hit her hard, and she was
wondering if it would be possible to persuade
Tom...
</p>

<p>
"When is the next Meeting&mdash;and where?" she said.
</p>

<p>
Gay told her, and making a rapid calculation
of dates and engagements, Effie exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"There's no racing that day!  Look here, Gay,
I'll use every means of bribery and corruption to
get Tom to drive us down&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't," said Gay coldly.  "Put it on the bare
ground of loyalty to a friend."
</p>

<p>
"Call it what you like.  And if he does, we'll
stick to you like burrs&mdash;anyone who cheapens
you, takes on the three&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Effie," said Gay quietly, but
wishing all the same that her friend had done the
right thing, without having the way pointed out
to her so violently.
</p>

<p>
"Come out," cried Effie briskly&mdash;"come out
and show yourself.  My motor's at the door.  Put
on your smartest hat and clothes, and your best
'don't-care-a-damn' smile, and face the music."
</p>

<p>
Gay did, and by the time they had shopped in
Bond Street, traversed Piccadilly twice, dropped
in at Effie's club, and fooled round generally till
lunch-time, then attended an At Home or two,
winding up with tea at Rumpelmeyer's, it was the
general opinion of those who saw her, that the
person least ashamed of what she had done the
preceding day, was Miss Gay Lawless.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
A TICKLISH MOMENT
</h3>

<p>
Tom Bulteel, red-faced, blue-eyed, taciturn, with
Gay beside, and his wife and Rensslaer behind
him, tooled his bays down to the next Trotting
Meeting, and tried to look as pleasant as the
character of the big crowd and unwonted
surroundings permitted.  The attendance was a
record one, the front of the track thronged with
people, while the number of conveyances of all
kinds, from waggonettes to nondescript traps,
was altogether phenomenal, for it was the
expectation of seeing Miss Lawless drive again,
and also the possibility of Rensslaer doing so,
that had brought down a strong contingent of the
press.  A multitude of snapshotters attended her
every look and movement, those, however, who
expected an Amazon, found a pretty, modest little
girl, very quietly dressed, under the powerful ægis
of the well-known Captain and Mrs. Bulteel, and
the boisterous half-cheer of greeting from the
Ring that broke forth at sight of her when the
coach swept up, was somehow never finished.
</p>

<p>
Probably if Rensslaer had not been present at
her recent new departure, and displayed such an
obvious interest in her, no particular scandal
would have attached to it, and Gay's driving
herself been regarded merely as the bold freak
of a free-and-easy young lady, who went in for a
free-and-easy sport, and as such applauded.
But his close attendance had focussed public
attention upon her, inclining an eager trotting
world to the belief that she had converted him to
her views, and that shortly he would bring his
enormous experience, superb driving, and splendid
cattle to the sport, thereby giving it a tremendous
leg-up.  But in this also, as in Gay's case, they
were disappointed, for neither then, nor at any
subsequent time, did Rensslaer repeat his
performance on the Gold Cup day.
</p>

<p>
Min Toplady was there, and greeted Gay with
effusion when the latter went over to speak to
her, but nervously, too, for those "snapping
fiends," as she called them, who pursued Gay
everywhere, more than ever brought home to
Min the conviction that this Trotting business
was a hideous mistake on the part of so young
a girl, and that Gay's daring escapade had
cheapened, and inflicted a distinct loss of prestige
on her.  Thanks, however, to the countenance
afforded by Captain Bulteel and his wife, as they
made a tour of the track, she was everywhere
received with a silence that passed for respect,
instead of the familiar badinage that Min dreaded,
though if Gay appeared to notice nothing, she
was really having a very bad quarter of an hour,
and longing for it to be over.
</p>

<p>
Just before the second race, she and Rensslaer
strolled quietly down to the rails to investigate the
cause of a long delay, which was really owing to
the drivers all jockeying for a good start, when
the face of a little man in orange, driving a
handsome pacer, suddenly became such a vivid
study in emotions of fear, astonishment, and
horror, as made Gay glance quickly at her
companion for an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"It is only that he thought me in Paris," said
Rensslaer drily, "so is driving my private
sulky that I keep here for occasional use," and
Gay's face changed as she thought of that
delicious unlawful drive of hers, when Brusher
Tugwood had, unknown to her, borrowed
Rensslaer's wagon, and its owner by accident had
seen her, and so a new and delightful friendship
had come into her life.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, her mania had not been all loss&mdash;and
then, as much against his will, owing to false
starts, the guilty little man passed, and repassed
them, a fresh expression on his face every time,
and all intensely diverting, Gay laughed more
heartily than she had done for days past.
</p>

<p>
"What will you do to him?" she inquired,
wiping her eyes, when at last the horses had
started, the lightness and grace of Rensslaer's
wagon showing in favourable contrast to the
clumsy make of the English ones, but he only
shook his head; she knew well enough he would
do nothing.
</p>

<p>
They leaned forward, watching the race, and
soon it was apparent that a collision was
inevitable, as the man in the orange jacket unfairly
overhauled the leader; the next moment, the
wheels of both sulkies locked, and the driver of
the one "fouled," fell heavily on the track.
</p>

<p>
"Badly hurt, I'm afraid," said Rensslaer, and
Gay turned pale as she saw through her glasses
the faces of the crowd that had closed round the
prostrate man.  Almost at the same moment, a
cheer rang out, for the driverless horse decided
to race on his own account, pacing past in
grand style, and going much better on his own,
than when under control.  It really was a
remarkably pretty sight as he went round the
course four times at the rate of 2.40 a mile,
before he caught a wheel, and was easily stopped.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to beat it, really," exclaimed
Gay with some of her old enthusiasm, for she
honestly thought a trotter or pacer going his
fastest, a far greater example of the poetry of
motion than a racehorse.  "But do go and find
out if that poor fellow is very much hurt.  It was
a bad day for you when you came out, my little
man," she remarked to herself as Rensslaer
departed&mdash;"first to be caught, then to 'foul' and
half-kill your rival"&mdash;for soon she saw a sad
little procession winding away, and Rensslaer
returned to tell her that the driver's injuries were
very serious, and that he was on his way to a
local hospital.
</p>

<p>
This damped Gay's spirits.  She thought of
Chris, began to think that she brought bad luck,
and even her excellent prospects for the next
race did not cheer her, though in the event her
expectations were not justified.
</p>

<p>
The start was bad, and Gay's pacer went to a
break, losing probably fifty yards.  Miss Letty
brought the field along for the first half at a
merry gait, and Old Joker drew up to her, while
Gay's horse was a long way behind.  In the last
quarter of a mile he stepped a terrific gait, and
in spite of so much ground to make up, he looked
to have a chance, but one hundred yards from
the finish he went to a break, and Old Joker
gained the verdict.
</p>

<p>
Winner's gait per mile, 2.20, as Gay saw by
the stop-watch on her wrist that Rensslaer had
secured for her (similar to those used by the
judge and starters), which by pressure on a
button, registers the exact number of seconds in
which a race is won, also the time taken by the
second horse.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as Gay watched her man place a
cooler, with her monogram in the corner, over
the horse and sulky, completely covering both,
a great distaste, disgust even, for her surroundings
seized her.  All the bubbling joy that had attended
her new pursuit right up to the time of winning
the Gold Vase, was completely quenched in her,
and Chris's indignant protests against Mackrell's
encouraging her in so unsuitable a pursuit rang
in her ears, as she moved about with Rensslaer,
snapshotted here, stared out of countenance
there, though with nothing worse than a tentative
remark occasionally addressed to her by Trotting
habitués, who regarded her probably as one of
themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Better luck next time, miss," smirked one
obviously public-house gentleman, but Rensslaer
did not resent the freedom as Mackrell on her
account would have clone.  She had always been
quick to note that he evinced no distaste when
claimed in acquaintance by common persons in
the crowd, who seemed to look up to him with
almost supernatural admiration, and once again
Gay admired the simplicity of the man, the entire
absence of "side" that distinguished him, in
whatever company he found himself.
</p>

<p>
Luncheon was taken on the coach, and Gay's
second race, in which Maudie T. was successful,
coming on soon after, it was comparatively
early when Tom Bulteel headed his bays for
town.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God that's over!" he thought with
a sigh of relief, for disagreeable as the duty
was, at least his presence, and that of his
wife, had effectively saved Gay from overt
impertinence, and the running fire of chaff to
which only a coster-lady would have been
equal in reply.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
AUNT LAVINIA
</h3>

<p>
Unhappy about Chris, worried at Carlton's
self-expatriation, and deeply dissatisfied with her
sporting experiment, Gay got into the way of
going much oftener to the little South Street
house than usual; she even accompanied Aunt
Lavinia on some of her secret charitable errands,
and found her own troubles recede to very
trumpery affairs indeed, in the light of the real
tragedy of the poor that underlies all, especially
town life.
</p>

<p>
She began to question her right to waste
money as she did on Trotting and otherwise, and
her ambitions seemed puerile, even common, as
contrasted with those of this dear little lady, who
was always sowing as flowers in the King's
garden, the loving thoughts, the helpful deeds,
that unlike earthly flowers, would never fade.
And as Lavinia was growing old, and time was
short, she sowed as hard as she could, and
unhappy, selfish people looking at her, always
busy, always happy, wondered what her secret
was&mdash;Lossie would never learn it, but Gay
perhaps got some inkling in those visits to the
poor, where her bright face and warm heart
served her well.
</p>

<p>
It came as a great surprise to her to find that
Chris, who in an unobtrusive way helped his
less fortunate brothers of the pigskin far more
than he could afford, assisted many poor people
through Aunt Lavinia, and while she knew that
racing men are proverbially generous, not to say
princely, in their charities, she was greatly pleased
at this new light on his character.
</p>

<p>
"Chris has the loveliest disposition, and the
tenderest heart in the world, my dear&mdash;it's as big
as an ox's," said Lavinia one day, when she and
Gay were returning from a visit where they
had poured sympathy into a bereaved creature's
bleeding heart, and incidentally food and firing
into her larder and cellar.  "Carlton Mackrell
hasn't&mdash;and it's such a pity, as he's so rich, and
could help so much&mdash;but that's how it always is
in this world, and always will be."
</p>

<p>
Gay turned her head aside to hide a blush of
pleasure, for praise of Chris was very sweet to
her&mdash;indeed, he was so constantly in her thoughts,
that the merest shake brought his name to her
lips.
</p>

<p>
"He's always doing something kind to
somebody&mdash;except me," she said.  "He knows it
breaks my heart for him to ride, and he will
do it."
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy," said Aunt Lavinia, and sighed,
"he can't help it.  That passion for horses is in
the blood of his family.  You can spill it if you
like, but you can't get it out."
</p>

<p>
"But it's rough on other people," cried Gay.
"Chris gets all the fun, and those who love him
the sorrow."
</p>

<p>
"So you <i>do</i> love him, Gay?" said Aunt
Lavinia, who for all her goodness had on occasion
a most unsaintly twinkle in her eye, as at that
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Auntie, <i>who</i> would love a man who keeps
your heart in your mouth, and always&mdash;always in
a drivelling state of terror that he'll be brought
home to you in pieces, just alive in the biggest
piece?  I have a feeling that the mere thought
that <i>I expect</i> him to have an accident every
time, will bring about one!  I'd rather be
an old maid (I should never make a delightful
one like you) and dry-nurse Heron for the rest
of my life, than live in such a purgatory of hopes
and fears."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gay," said Aunt Lavinia, "he would die
in the way he liked, wouldn't he?  And real love
consists, not in making others do what we like,
but in wanting them to be happy, so long as it is
in no disgraceful way, let us suffer what we may.
I hate racing, as you know&mdash;but then I don't like
your Trotting at all either, my dear"&mdash;and shook
her head, Gay was on the wrong tack, but only
going through the mill would set her on the right
one.
</p>

<p>
Gay sighed.  She had long ago found that
Trotting, like marriage, "takes a lot of kidding,"
and the less she enjoyed it, the more she
"kidded," but not to herself, being by now very
sick of the fad that she had so light-heartedly
taken up.
</p>

<p>
The horses themselves, the actual racing part,
still appealed to her; she thought their action
the prettiest possible sight, and never lost her
pleasure in seeing them go&mdash;loved a close finish&mdash;it
was the surroundings that disgusted her.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, my fad is not dangerous to life&mdash;like
Chris's," she said, then suddenly remembered
the ugly fall she had witnessed from the tiny
perch on Rensslaer's borrowed sulky, and the
life-long injury to the back that ensued.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not both a little selfish, my dear?"
said Lavinia.  "Laddie, (her pet-name for Chris)
won't give up his racing, nor you your trotting&mdash;but
there is more reason in his asking the
sacrifice from you, than your demanding it
from him.  His mother did not."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Gay passionately, "knowing
what it must have cost her, how could he do it?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe there is a special Heaven to which
good sons go," said Lavinia, softly putting the
question by.  "I don't say good mothers&mdash;that's
natural&mdash;but to be a perfect son, and yet to be
a man at all points&mdash;a man of the world
even&mdash;like Chris&mdash;that's rare&mdash;rare and most
beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Then Lavinia confided to Gay with a blush
that the only reason she ever regretted not
having married&mdash;and at times she regretted
it intensely&mdash;was because she wanted a son&mdash;a
son like Chris.
</p>

<p>
"You and his mother were great friends,"
said Gay very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;if either of them could have any real
friend but each other.  They made the most
delightful pair.  Whenever you met them&mdash;and
they were never apart except when he was
racing&mdash;they were having no end of a good
time, and cutting jokes together&mdash;what one
said, the other thought, and it was always
amusing.  I remember her talking one day to
Chris about something she would do 'when she
was old and respectable,' and he said, 'you'll
never be old, and you'll never be respectable,'
and they both roared&mdash;it was a treat to see them
together."
</p>

<p>
"He will never think any other woman fit
to tie her shoe-string," said Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Lavinia, "she was by no means
perfect!  'Chris loves me for what I might have
been&mdash;not for what I am,' she said to me one
day.  But cheer up, Gay, the dear boy will put
on weight, and settle down quietly, and ride to
hounds like any other country gentleman, once
you are married."
</p>

<p>
But Gay could not see Chris jogging to
hounds on a weight-carrier, and she worried a
good deal in a quiet way.  The world said there
was nothing like taking up a man's pursuits to
rub the bloom off a girl's face, and being so
famous&mdash;or notorious&mdash;had by no means
improved her.
</p>

<p>
Something of her snap and freshness had
departed, and Min Toplady, who occasionally saw
her at Meetings, observed with much concern
that her young lady had grown thinner, quieter,
that the radiant girl who had gone to Inigo
Court with Chris, to applaud Carlton Mackrell
when he won, had vanished, seemingly never to
return.  Min wished that gentleman would
come home, persuade Gay to marry him, and
settle down in the country as a sporting squire,
with her for the Lady Bountiful that Nature had
plainly cut her out to be.  Of course Mr. Chris
was a dangerous rival, but neither rich like the
other, nor desirable as a husband, from the
habit he had of risking his neck whenever he
got a chance.  And Min did not think Miss Gay
would elect to live with her heart in her mouth
for at least six months out of every year, so that
the betting was at least even on Carlton Mackrell.
Of course, <i>that</i> Miss Lossie was always waiting to
cut in, and get the latter for herself, but, as
Min vulgarly expressed it in her own mind, he
wasn't taking any.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the Professor did not worry Gay,
for as if to make up for wasted time, and terrified
of meeting Lossie, he had disappeared among
his microscopes and tubes, and burrowed there.
He seemed, as Gay expressed it, to be chewing
the cud of ticklish experiments that wouldn't
come off, and when he went down to see Chris,
he did not offer to take her, nor did she
propose to accompany him, for even while her heart
yearned over the boy, she felt for him a curious
anger, realising all that his love of steeplechasing
cost her.
</p>

<p>
He also was having by no means a rosy time,
either in body or mind, for by careful editing,
she was made to furnish spicy tit-bits to the
newspapers, and he raged at the accident that
had put him out of the running in more ways
than one, just when Gay had never so badly
wanted all her friends.
</p>

<p>
Brusher Tugwood's disgust at Carlton
Mackrell's expulsion had been deep and bitter.
He always persisted in it that private spite was
at the bottom of the affair, that his master had
been too successful in beating the public-house
pacers, and he also resented Gay's lukewarm
interest in the sport she had taken up so keenly,
and blamed her for not interesting Rensslaer in
it to some practical purpose.
</p>

<p>
But now, to all lovers of horses, a new topic
had arisen.  There had begun to loom up in the
public view, a forthcoming International Horse
Show at Olympia, that was to eclipse anything of
the kind ever before seen in England.
</p>

<p>
At first women took but a languid interest in
it, and if anyone had predicted that all London
would literally besiege the historic hall to catch
a glimpse of the wonderful arena, and the
brilliant equine contests conducted therein, he
would have been laughed out of court.  But when
a whisper flew round that it was to be <i>the</i> big
social event of the season, that the King and
Queen were going, and it would be a place for
one's very smartest frock and hat, also that at
least six millionaires had entered the pick of
their studs, and over two thousand entries were
already made, public attention awoke; everywhere
horses, and the sumptuous surroundings
they were to have, became the principal topic of
conversation.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that although Great Britain had all
the time been the premier horse-breeding country
of the world, it was only now that Englishmen
in general had awakened to the fact&mdash;strange in
a horse-breeding nation, that had for one and a
half centuries, prided itself upon its devotion to,
and its pre-eminence in, this all-important
matter!
</p>

<p>
It was a surprise to Gay to find that Rensslaer
took so much interest in it, for she knew him to
be a rather severe critic of horse shows in general
(he excepted shows such as Richmond, etc.), his
criticisms being based on firm foundations, but
she quickly discovered how completely his heart
was in it, when he discussed animatedly with her
the scope of the idea.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he said, "in England hitherto a
horse show has been designed solely for horsey
people&mdash;for those who desire to buy and sell; the
scene is gloomy, and in consequence the spectators
consist almost entirely of men, only the horsiest
women attending them."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> know," said Gay, making a little face, for
she had attended one with enthusiastic Chris&mdash;to
her sorrow.
</p>

<p>
"The curious thing is," went on Rensslaer,
"that though horse shows undoubtedly originated
in England, starting with classes for young
breeding stock at the agricultural shows as early
as 1840, the development of this idea is
undoubtedly due to a book&mdash;Mr. Samuel Sidney's
'Book of the Horse.'  From that time the movement
spread in Europe, America, and the Colonies,
and the International view was taken up by
foreign supporters of horse shows, who held them
in Paris, Berlin, Brussels, The Hague, Chicago,
and New York."
</p>

<p>
"Especially New York," said Gay.  "Is it
true that the Madison Square Gardens Horse
Show sets the American fashion for the year?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;the public goes to view the show, but
the show that it views is in the boxes, not the
ring.  The horses?  Oh! there are some very
fine horses shown, and the papers devote a
quarter of a column or so to describing them.
But it's a good thing all the same."
</p>

<p>
"It's time we 'bucked up,' for England was
dropping behind a bit," said Gay confidentially.
"But what can you expect with Free Trade, and
the present Government?"
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer laughed.
</p>

<p>
"She won't be behind this time.  No such
show will ever have been held in England.  The
great point is, that the thing has been so
conceived that the most unintelligent mind on horsey
affairs may be thoroughly interested.  In those
details where every other horse show usually
bores, because of tedious routine, this one will
appeal to the expert, and non-expert, and if you'll
contrast jumps made of real turf, with the way
other shows are done, with bare boards and dirty
hurdles as the enclosure of the ring, you'll see the
improvement.  Then the natural disappointment
among foreign visitors that there are no English
gentlemen of the same class to ride against, is
being met&mdash;no grooms will be seen in the ring,
and a great effort is being made to get English
officers themselves to ride."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is a move in the right direction
that gentlemen in appropriate costume should
ride the jumpers, and not dirty stable-boys in
hobnailed boots," said Gay, thinking of how
Chris would have <i>loved</i> to ride, and how
delightful he would have looked.
</p>

<p>
"It's astonishing how much better a gentleman
sits, and in how much better form he rides," said
Rensslaer, "so that the moment he commences
riding, you can tell he is one."
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded; she had often remarked it.
</p>

<p>
"We hope to have picked out the best
features of every International Horse Show,"
said Rensslaer.  "The system of having
appointment classes, will spare the public the
ugly sight of seeing horses driven in quite
inappropriate carriages, such as a fat hackney
in an American speed wagon, and so on, thus
a great impetus will be given to the carriage
trade.  Then there will be the ladies' 'George the
Fourth' phaeton class, a low two-horse carriage
with a seat for a servant behind, which is the
proper carriage for ladies driving, instead of a
high dogcart, or any two-wheeled carriage, which is
only fit for a publican's wife out on a bank holiday."
</p>

<p>
"Or a Trotting Meeting," said Gay slyly.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt," he said, "that the show
will do good, not only by welding the forces of
breeders, exhibitors, and dealers together, but
also by encouraging the breeding of the best type
of the English horse, and thus help to remove one
of the most serious objections to automobilism&mdash;the
fear that it will result in the ultimate extinction
of the horse.  It will be the finest display
of horse-flesh and of horsemanship that has ever
been seen on so gigantic a scale in England, or
perhaps even in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I hope we are all right!" exclaimed Gay,
jealous for her mother-country.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rensslaer, "though the competition
of America and the Continent will be strong,
and meet with a certain amount of success, I
think the English exhibitors will hold their own,
and from whatever country the winners come, it
is always the English strain that wins, though
the fact is possibly more obvious to the foreigner
than to ourselves.  I want you and the Professor
to come to Elsinore one day, and see what I am
sending&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Gay declared this to be impossible; her
brother had completely withdrawn into his
scientific shell, and to dislodge him was
impossible.  Besides, Rensslaer had delayed so
long in inviting them, a little to her surprise,
that now she felt in no particular hurry to go,
and he did not press the point.  It was only
later that she discovered in his apparent
inhospitality, but another instance of Rensslaer's
fine tact, how it was not until he knew her to be
finally disgusted with Trotting as a sport, that he
showed her the real thing, the game as it should be
played, such Trotters as she had never dreamed of.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to say why Rensslaer, in
whose life women had no place, (though he had
his own romance hidden away, as Gay had
always suspected), took so much interest in the
girl, gave her so much precious time, when in
his many-sided life, and the multiplicity and
engrossing interest of his hobbies, he had none to
spare for his old friends, much less for society,
which he despised.
</p>

<p>
But he liked her sporting spirit when first
he saw her at Inigo Court, pitied her for the
disillusion that her Trotting passion was bound
to bring her, admired her pluck when things went
wrong, found her true-hearted, honest and kind,
therefore after his own heart.
</p>

<p>
Yet when he went presently away, he somewhat
sadly thought of the careless, happy girl, enthusing
about her Trotters, whom he had found on his
first visit.  Unconsciously he murmured to himself:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Give her back her youth again,<br>
  Let her be as she was then!<br>
  Let her wave her little hand<br>
  With its gesture of command...."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yes, even the lightest bruise on youth,
splendid, unbroken, unconscious even in its
selfishness, was a pity.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
KING OF THE ROAD
</h3>

<p>
Lossie, waiting in the tiny blue dining-room in
South Street for Gay to fetch her, glanced round
at the blue walls, the old copper prints, the bits
of old Nankin, at the flowers on the table, blue
also, and looking in the glass at those bluer
flowers in her own head, felt a sudden nostalgia, a
longing to have Carlton Mackrell beside her in her
own <i>milieu</i>.  It is what a woman in love always
wants, and everyday her pain at the deprivation
of Carlton's society became sharper, for there
is no greater spendthrift in love than the selfish
woman who has the full intention, <i>bien entendu</i>, of
getting her own back, in one form or another.
</p>

<p>
Turning to the window, she saw Gay drive up,
and cheerily wave her whip to her&mdash;that was the
disgusting thing about Gay, that whether really
happy, or only pretending, she always pluckily
tried to live up to her name, thought Lossie, as
she went out, pretending to herself that she was
a mere cat's-paw, to be used or ignored by Gay
as occasion served, but really glad of the
opportunity of displaying her lovely clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Lavinia's slumming," said Lossie, in
reply to the other's query, as she climbed to her
perch.  "Why don't you start a motor?" she
grumbled.  "This Ralli car is so selfish&mdash;you can't
give your friends any sort of a time with it, or take
them any distance.  Nowadays one must either
motor or be motored&mdash;and I prefer to do the
motoring myself."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," replied Gay with spirit, "I'm
like Roosevelt&mdash;when someone asked him the
other day when he was going to buy a motor-car,
he said not while there were horses!  I think
it's just splendid," she added warmly, "for the
Americans to come over here, and revive our
rapidly waning interest in horses, and if some
of our English millionaires spent their money in
the same way, then so much the better would it
be for horses, and for us!  The horse is our friend
even more than the dog, and I'd like to see him
kept for enjoyment, not degraded to rough street
work&mdash;<i>that's</i> where the motor-car should come in!"
</p>

<p>
Lossie did not trouble to argue the point, she
was better occupied in watching the effect of
her beauty on the passers-by, and certainly the
despised Ralli was very smartly turned out, as
usual.  The occasion, too, was pleasant, for they
were on their way to see Mr. Vanderbilt's coach
start from the Berkeley Hotel on its trial trip to
Brighton, hence Gay's delight at the fillip given
to coaching.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to have troubled much about
your Trotters lately," said Lossie presently as they
turned into Berkeley Square.  "Yet here is poor
Carlton hounded out of England, treated like any
low welsher, because you fancied a wretched Gold
Vase!  I wonder you dare show your face at the
Meetings as you do!"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't," said Gay with spirit, "if I had
a face as sour as yours is at this moment!
Really, Lossie, when I look at you, I feel
thankful I wasn't born a beauty&mdash;it makes you
leave everything else&mdash;manners, good temper,
such lots of nice things, to chance, and the odds
are forty to one!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we can't <i>all</i> be a dear, artless little
thing, truckling to men's brutal prejudices&mdash;one
reason you are so popular with them is, because
you pretend you don't want women to have the
vote!" cried Lossie.
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I!" cried Gay warmly.  "I consider
an excited, shrieking crowd of sober women
clamouring for their rights, more indecent than a
crowd of men drunk who <i>don't</i> clamour, and
when it comes to slapping policemen's faces,
padlocking themselves to railings, and rolling in
gutters, it makes me ashamed of wearing a
petticoat!"
</p>

<p>
"Brains never were your strong point, Gay,"
said Lossie comfortably, and Gay emphatically
thanked Heaven they were <i>not</i>.
</p>

<p>
"The most rabid shrieker of them all would
become mild as milk, if her own little baby were
put in her arms, and she had her own man to love
her," declared Gay.  "And as there aren't enough
men to go round, why don't the women emigrate,
and fulfil themselves somewhere else?"
</p>

<p>
"All women are not so primitive as you are,"
said Lossie, sneering, unaware that it was the
capacity to <i>feel</i> love as well as evoke it, that
made much of Gay's charm; at the back of all her
follies was a heart of gold, while a cherry stone
represented Lossie's own assets in that particular,
save where Carlton was concerned.
</p>

<p>
But there was no time for further argument,
for they found themselves jammed in the midst
of a crowd delighted at the recrudescence of the
horse, with his grace, beauty, speed, and spirit,
just as ten years ago a similar crowd had
assembled to see start for the same destination,
that marvel of power and ingenuity which was
expected to displace him&mdash;the motor-car.
</p>

<p>
The glorious days of the "Old Times" coach
seemed to be revived when, drawn by four
beautiful greys, their manes braided with red and
white ribbons, their heads decked with red and
white camelias, a clean-shaven, eager-faced young
man, with keen dark eyes, the correct blackness
of whose attire was broken by his large red and
white buttonhole, brought his coach up with a
flourish, and followed by shouts and cheers
and many cries of "Good luck," shortly sent it
on its way.
</p>

<p>
Smarter than ever in his tightly-fitting coat,
showing the neatly-folded four-in-hand tie, and
segment of scarlet gold-buttoned waistcoat,
Godden sprang from the leaders' heads, and
climbing to his place, blew a cheery blast upon
his coach-horn.  And then began the American's
triumph, for he could not have driven a hundred
yards before he found the reward of his enterprise
in the way the people, whether on foot or
awheel, recognised, and gave way to him as king
of the road.
</p>

<p>
Immediately the way was clear, and at a
spanking trot, the coach went bowling along,
every horse-drawn or motor-driven vehicle,
effacing itself in honour of the fine team.  The
crowd's eyes sparkled with pleasure and welcome
at the sight, policemen saluted, women fluttered
their handkerchiefs, men cheered, the while
Godden cheerfully chirruped a return of their
welcome and good wishes, but of all the people
in the streets, those to whom the sight of the
splendid horses gave the most joy, were the
cabbies, who took off their hats to a man, and
waved them with ecstatic delight, shouting themselves
hoarse, and nearly falling off their boxes
in the process.
</p>

<p>
It was a royal progress from start to finish&mdash;from
the time the greys, that had not turned a
hair, were changed, and four browns substituted,
to the mixed team of two chestnut wheelers,
black near leader, and grey on the off lead, that
in turn gave way to one of perfectly matched
black-browns.  At every stage there was a
big crowd, till at Brighton it ended in an
extraordinary demonstration of enthusiasm, and
through dense, cheering masses that only left a
narrow lane for the coach's passage, the Metropole
was reached.
</p>

<p>
Blocked in the crowd, Gay inclined an eager
ear to the cheers that ran down Piccadilly.  She
would have loved to go all the way ... her
thoughts swerved sharply to racing, which was
dangerous, wicked even&mdash;did not the poor horses
often break their hearts, either dying on the
course, or quietly after the race in their stables?
</p>

<p>
And Trotting was apparently disgraceful (in
England), but to drive a coach with such horses
as she had just seen&mdash;why, that would be at
once heavenly and <i>right</i>, thought Gay, as she
listened to the echoes, and tried to imagine
herself handling the ribbons of the Vanderbilt
coach.
</p>

<p>
She longed for someone congenial to talk with,
and as if in answer to her wish, Rensslaer, ducking
under the horses' heads, suddenly appeared at
her elbow, and Gay's enthusiasm boiled over.
</p>

<p>
"Even if it <i>is</i> only a passing excitement for a
man to whose great wealth the newest crazes and
the most costly distractions are mere commonplaces,"
she said, "anyway its a more noble one
than any of the other American millionaires have
thought of, and Mr. Vanderbilt deserves all the
credit as a true sportsman that is already his,
or I'm much mistaken."
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you rather hard on millionaires," he
said, "almost as hard as your favourite Roosevelt,
who has a healthy hatred for the multi-millionaire,&mdash;says
he is worse than a demagogue?  He quotes
some chap who declares that the multi's face has
grown hard, while his body has grown soft, that
his son is a fool, and his daughter a foreign
princess, and his nominal pleasures at the best
those of tasteless and extravagant luxury, but
whose real delight, and real life-work, are the
accumulation and use of power in the most
sordid, and least elevating form!"
</p>

<p>
"Out of breath, aren't you?" said Gay.
"Well, thank Heaven you're not a multi"&mdash;not
knowing that Rensslaer <i>was</i>&mdash;"at least he would
admit that you are doing good work with this
wonderful Horse Show."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, I heard from Mr. Mackrell
yesterday," said Rensslaer.  "He is coming over
for it."
</p>

<p>
Gay, looking between her horse's ears, waiting
for the uplifted hand of the constable to fall, and
release the traffic, turned pale.  There are some
debts of honour more binding than the friend's
I.O.U. that is never presented, and Gay felt
that Carlton's was one of them&mdash;a queer
prophetic instinct told her that this Horse Show
was to be the turning point of her life.
</p>

<p>
"I was glad to find Mr. Hannen so much
better when I went to see him yesterday," went
on Rensslaer.  "He told me he hoped to be well
enough to call on you next week"&mdash;here he
ducked, and disappeared as the policeman's hand
fell, but Lossie, whose ears were quick, was in
the seventh heaven of delight.
</p>

<p>
Carlton was coming back; Chris, whose
absence and misfortune had melted Gay's heart,
thinned her body, and almost quenched her
bloom, was appearing once more on the
scene&mdash;everything promised well.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
AT ELSINORE
</h3>

<p>
After all, it was chance that dictated Gay
should go to Elsinore, or rather the accident
of Rensslaer's having cut in just before the
Professor, and obtained a certain rare edition
that the latter greatly coveted.  He would
cheerfully have started for Kamschatka to read
or borrow it; Elsinore was nearer, and when
Gay mentioned the invitation, he jumped at it,
and went.
</p>

<p>
So one fine morning in May found brother
and sister in the train, and Rensslaer waited
for them at the station with a pair of magnificent
Trotting horses, harnessed to a light road wagon
of hickory wood and steel.  Inviting Gay to
share the very small seat with him, he pointed
out, to the Professor's intense relief, a sober
open carriage for the latter's use.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, Gay," Frank cried quaveringly
after her, as she squeezed in beside Rensslaer,
and the next moment, her host's hands twisted
into the loops of the reins, they were sweeping
through the silent streets, and out on to the open
road, the air whistling in their ears, the dust
striking Gay's eyes and cheeks like pellets, the
country almost indistinguishable as they flew
past, and the sensation so thrilling that she
surrendered herself to it in complete enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Smoothly as a sleigh on snow, rode the frail
vehicle of less than a hundred pounds, and
record-makers both, were the powerful steeds that guided
by the imperturbable driver with arms
outstretched, swift as the wind, swept up hill and
down dale, only once beaten by a motor that
was afterwards overtaken, and then Rensslaer
eased his steeds, remarking that they had
covered five miles in twelve minutes.
</p>

<p>
By then they were in his park, and the
horses went more quietly, so that Gay had leisure
to observe the sylvan beauty of the landscape
surrounding Elsinore, to notice the herds of
deer visible in every direction, and also his
Indian fighting cocks, who roamed his fields in
intermittent warfare with the old English game.
Somehow Gay felt that all were sharers in that
instinct of friendliness which seemed to inspire his
relations, not only with all his dumb retainers,
but with his fellow-humans as well.
</p>

<p>
Original in his house as in everything else,
Elsinore was an extended copy of a Russian
peasant's cottage.  Made of logs, with a great
deal of carving in wood, and a big Russian stove
in each room, the furniture was covered with
linen, embroidered in blue and red by Russian
peasants, the tiles of the stoves being incised in
dark blue, red, emerald green, and gold with
white, in true peasant style.
</p>

<p>
Simplicity was evidently his rule of life, but one
room was filled to the ceiling with books, and to
this the Professor naturally gravitated on his
arrival.  Leaving him perfectly happy among
those rare editions of which at odd times
Rensslaer was an inveterate collector, Gay and
her host sauntered through the quaint house,
singularly modest for the far-spreading park
surrounding it, but containing many trophies of
his skill, and to her utter astonishment, in other
realms than that of sport.
</p>

<p>
The cases full of gold and silver medals, of
stars and decorations, interested her very little,
nor did Rensslaer trouble to explain that none of
those prizes were for horses, but for a domain in
which he stood alone as champion of the world.
But she came to a full stop before the figure,
raised on a pedestal, of a girl with strange barbaric
head-dress above her sweet face, hands folded
on breast, and the drapery a little blown away
from the exquisite line of back and hips, and
"Exhibited Allied Artists, 190-" written below.
</p>

<p>
"That's La Russie," he said.  "The colouring
and tinting are an exact reproduction of the
actual dress and jewels."
</p>

<p>
"It's beautiful," said Gay, to whom the colouring
mattered nothing but the idea was everything,
and reluctantly she tore herself away to look at
an Indian Chief in all his war paint, and modelled
in silver, on a table hard by.
</p>

<p>
From the summit of his brow, and outlining
his haughty back, his feathers made a regal
silhouette that extended beyond his horse's tail,
and the contrast of his grim impassivity, and icy
air of detachment, with the horse's eagerness as
it strained forward was marvellously rendered,
making Gay declare that the horse was a dear,
and that whoever did that, must love horses.
</p>

<p>
The same remark applied to a model of
Ascetics Silver, winner of the Grand National
1906, his ribs plainly showing, his upward,
proudly-soaring eye, dilated nostrils, and the
veins standing out on his face and body, drawing
from her a cry of delight.  Beneath was written,
"Exhibited Paris Society Animal Painters," and
the name of the sculptor made the girl jump.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> did <i>that?</i>" she cried incredulously, the
colour rushing to her face.
</p>

<p>
"And here is my Little Mermaid," said
Rensslaer, and Gay knew that what she saw
before her was dear to him.
</p>

<p>
"What a darling!" she exclaimed, and indeed
it was a sweet little body, with childish, startled
eyes, and hands impulsively put up to her cheeks.
One could <i>see</i> the grief and horror in the poor
little thing's face&mdash;for of course she was watching
her beautiful human prince being married, and the
tears seemed to be just coming.
</p>

<p>
It was a wonderful piece of work, and threw a
new light on Rensslaer's character.  Gay realised
vividly how strong the love of beauty was in him,
how great the power that enabled him to create
it, how profoundly some human experience must
have wrought in his mind to produce such results.
</p>

<p>
She was silent, shy even, as he showed her the
picture of his grandfather, who had written a
wonderful book on religion that had estranged
him from his family, and that the Professor was
even at that moment handling reverently in the
library.
</p>

<p>
"And this is my great-great-great-grandfather,"
said Rensslaer as they turned from the inspired
head, the tremendous intellectual force of the
author, to an obvious Dutchman of quite another
type, but just as remarkable.
</p>

<p>
"He was a famous Dutch painter&mdash;our present
name is an ugly corruption of his.  We can't help
it," said Rensslaer whimsically, "we must all
follow art in one form or another&mdash;"  And this was
the man who, by the irony of circumstance, was
by the multitude supposed to regard fast Trotting
as the be-all and end-all of life!  Gay blushed to
think of his amusement when she at first regarded
him in the same light&mdash;it was perhaps to correct
this impression that he had invited her here, but
no, he was too modest, too sincere for that.
</p>

<p>
"I've never wanted to be a man till I knew
you," said Gay a little enviously; "you turn
perpetually from one thing to another, and there
can be no dull moment in your existence."
</p>

<p>
Was there not?  Across his brown eyes came
a shadow that gave the lie to her words, and
once again Gay wondered what the secret
romance of his life was, this man whose ideals of
beauty were of the highest, as his capacity for
interpreting them, a conjunction that is very rare.
</p>

<p>
They were looking at an extraordinary
collection of pistols of which Rensslaer merely
pointed out the exquisite workmanship, and it
had just occurred to her that she had heard
somewhere that he was a fine shot, when a
servant came to announce luncheon, and on
looking for the Professor, they found him where
they had left him.  He had merely moved
entranced from book to book that he had long
coveted, and one rare edition had almost, as
Frank confessed, slid into his coat-tail pocket, so
that when Rensslaer asked him to accept it, his
joy knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
Yet, after all, Rensslaer's heart was in his
horses, not books, as Gay discovered, when after
luncheon, followed by the Italian greyhound that
adored and never willingly left him, they walked
towards the racing track, on the inside of which
was turf smooth as a billiard-table, and surrounding
it in the distance, a great belt of glorious trees.
</p>

<p>
Gay glanced round eagerly; there was no sign
of a horse anywhere, no stables within sight or
hearing, only a peaceful sylvan landscape.  Perfect
quiet prevailed as Rensslaer explained to her
that his Trotters were practised, not on the track,
but on grass, if they were to be shown where the
ring is of grass, as otherwise a trotter would be
apt to break.
</p>

<p>
"This grass is kept mown very short, and
the turns are purposely not banked up," said
Rensslaer, "as they never are at English horse
shows, and the horses have to get used to it.  I
shoe my horses with spikes when showing, so
that they shall not slip up, and have strong wheels
made for my speed wagons, as the strain on
unbanked-up turns, is apt to buckle a very light
wheel, which is quite safe on turns that are
banked-up.
</p>

<p>
He then showed her that on the half-mile
track there were quarter-mile posts, and also
eighth of a mile posts at the ends of the
"straights"; the track was two "straights,"
of an eighth, and two turns of an eighth of a
mile at each end.
</p>

<p>
"A horse's utmost speed for an eighth can
thus be tested," said Rensslaer.  "It is never
advisable to put a horse at his utmost limit for
more than an eighth."
</p>

<p>
Excusing himself for a brief minute, Gay next
saw him in enormous goggles, bunched up on
a slender sulky weighing about twenty-eight
pounds, swinging round curves behind a Trotter
that did half a mile in about a minute or so, and
yet never broke into a gallop, and Gay realised
that not so much in his Trotters themselves, as in
the masterly driving of them, Rensslaer's pleasure
consisted.  He held his arms differently&mdash;he
drove differently to anyone she had seen before,
in its essence his was the same deep joy that
Chris found in the riding at which he excelled.
</p>

<p>
Her heart warmed to him as she thought of
how he had spared her the humiliation of knowing
that Mackrell and she had been playing at a bad
make-believe all the time, that the difference
between their horses and Rensslaer's was, that his
had quality, shape, and soundness&mdash;they looked
like well-bred chargers, carried themselves with
perfect balance, their hind legs well under them,
stopping at a word without any pulling or fighting,
and when the mile was finished, standing quite
still.  The sort of horse to which she and Carlton
were accustomed, were mostly unsound old
screws which had a fast record in America
many years before, but having broken down,
or being otherwise cheap, had been bought and
patched up, then raced in England.
</p>

<p>
At first they had horrified Gay, these poor old
raw-boned pacers with bent knees and hobbles,
pulling all on one rein, with any amount of
appliances to enable the man who was pulling for
dear life to be able to hold them, or else little rats
of Iceland ponies shuffling along, and only fit to
be seen in a coster's barrow.
</p>

<p>
"And to think," cried Gay, in tragic tones,
"that Carlton and I fancied <i>ourselves</i>&mdash;our
trotters, I mean!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Rensslaer, "although speed
is the first essential, I will have no horse which
is not absolutely sound, has not good manners,
and does not have to wear boots (except as a
precaution against accident when racing), and
a light mouth."
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded.  She had for the first time
discovered how deceptive the long, raking stride
of a record trotter is, for without appearing to
move fast, he is yet making phenomenal time on
the track, as drawing the light, four-wheeled
racing wagon with rubber-tyred bicycle wheels,
he glides smoothly along.
</p>

<p>
Then one by one, or in pairs, the finest animals
in the stables were shown.  Yet with so little effort
did horse after horse, team after team, draw up
under the trees in the background, and succeed
each other, that they only blended with the
beauty of the landscape, did not disturb it, and
Gay presently gave a great sigh of delight.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "it's too much!  I'd like the
whole world to enjoy it&mdash;it's too good for poor
little me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rensslaer quietly, "it will&mdash;later."
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely day, with zephyr breezes&mdash;the
great charm of it all was, that there was nothing
to suggest the circus or show ring, no crowd, no
betting, no shouting hoarse voices to break the
peace, only splendid animals full of fire, energy,
and work, who were just going at their best
for sheer joy in life, joy in their own swiftness,
strength and beauty, delighted to run their race
with the green sward underfoot, and the blue
sky overhead.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer had made her free of a new and
glorious world&mdash;the world of horses, Chris's
world.  She longed for him to be there also, for
though she keenly appreciated the daintiness of
these thoroughbreds, their delicate legs and feet,
the sheen of their satin coats, their perfection
of grace and movement, she yet felt that she was
not sufficiently a connoisseur to give to every
point its full value, as Chris would so well have
known how to do.
</p>

<p>
"Getting ready for Olympia," said Rensslaer,
as a thoroughbred galloper was harnessed in a
jogging cart, and accompanied the trotters at a
hard gallop, often being put to his utmost stretch
to keep up with them, after which Rensslaer
showed her several "eighths" in 15 seconds, a
two-minute speed for a mile.
</p>

<p>
"Just fancy if that dare-devil and Chris got
together!" whispered Gay when there rode
out from beneath the trees a superb horseman,
young, cool as a cucumber, who, riding the
centre horse, holding the two outside ones, put
them at an obstacle that they cleared like
birds.
</p>

<p>
"He has broken every bone in his body,"
said Rensslaer grimly; "the last time the doctor
said it was his back, but he wouldn't admit
it&mdash;and here he is, you see!"
</p>

<p>
The boy gave them a taste of his quality
when presently his horse twice swerved aside
from the jump, an American runabout luggage
wagon, but cleared it the third time&mdash;and once
more Gay thought of Chris, for the two men
were alike in not knowing what fear was.  The
resemblance between the two physically, struck
her at once&mdash;each was tall, and lean to a fault,
each had the same dash and devilry, the same
indomitable pluck, each took an "outing" as
part of the day's sport, and with the fixed purpose
to go on doing and daring, and as by a miracle
each had hitherto escaped the clutching hand of
death, and flown beyond its reach.
</p>

<p>
And yet&mdash;and yet, as Chris said, could one
die better?  She recalled Robert Louis
Stevenson's query, "<i>And does not life go down
with a better grace, foaming in full body over a
precipice, than miserably straggling to an end in
sandy deltas?</i>"
</p>

<p>
Those two magnificent horsemen, Whyte
Melville and Hughie Owen, went out at the
sport that they loved, and save for those whom
they loved, would they have wished to go
any differently?
</p>

<p>
"I'm very proud of my jumpers," said Rensslaer,
who was a keen hunting man, getting in his six
days a week during the winter.  "That horse"&mdash;he
pointed one out&mdash;"was parted with by his
former owner because he could not jump, and
since then, he has cleared six feet ten inches high,
and once a seven-feet jump.  But the Belgians
will win the high-jumping competition at
Olympia&mdash;Belgian officers easily out-jump the
world,"&mdash;and he related some notable feats of theirs,
remarking with great approval that they govern
their horses by kindness.  "As you do,"
thought Gay.
</p>

<p>
"That," said Rensslaer, as the handsome
rider of a beautiful roan gelding made his horse
dance, and paw, and prance with extraordinary
perfection, in all the tricks of the <i>Haute École</i>,
"is the best show rider in Europe."
</p>

<p>
And so the "private view" went on, it was all
quite effortless, and apparently so unpremeditated,
then presently, as she and Rensslaer quietly
chatted, Gay felt the peace accentuated, and
glanced around.  They had the wide, lovely
park to themselves; the distant trees, beneath
which had emerged the pick of the world's
equine beauty, threw long shadows on the
sward only, and Rensslaer, glancing at his watch,
remarked that the Professor would think they
were lost.
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellow!  What he has missed!" said
Gay, while Frank, wrapped in ecstasy, was
oblivious of time and place, of everything but
having the run of a treasure-house to which
eternity itself could not enable him to do full
justice.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer showed her the polo ground, and
part of the steeplechase course, two miles long,
then proposed a visit to the stables that were so
completely invisible from the park or house.  But
now he turned sharply to the side of the latter,
and by a steep, winding path concealed among
trees, they emerged on the great quadrangle.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
AN EQUINE PARADISE
</h3>

<p>
In striking contrast to the simplicity of Rensslaer's
house was the vastness of these outdoor belongings,
where was celebrated the cult, the worship,
the very apotheosis of the horse, and yet the
atmosphere was one of rest; the sunlight slanted
through the green boughs that overhung the
wall, the water sparkled in the centre, there were
no signs of hurry, and but few visible of the
small army that served the beauties in their
stalls and loose boxes.  There must be magnificent
organisation here, thought Gay, as she noted
the noiseless, perfect machinery&mdash;when a man
was wanted, he sprang up, when not wanted, was
not to be seen, and without raising his voice,
Rensslaer's orders were implicitly obeyed&mdash;even
for the "show" arranged that afternoon he had
merely dropped a few words to his stud groom,
and the thing had gone by itself.
</p>

<p>
As she moved from horse to horse, each with
his famous name on the wall above, and below,
a print of one equally famous, and in the centre,
a superb medallion in marble of a famous
trotter going at full speed, Gay admired the
way they just turned their heads to look quietly
at her, like the true aristocrats that they were.
But Rensslaer was another matter&mdash;they knew
him even better than he knew them, and
manifested the most lively pleasure when he
called each by name.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" he exclaimed, as Gay approached
a veteran of twenty-one years old, who was only
retired for old age, after racing till he was nine,
getting a record at 2.15, and then being driven
constantly hard on the road till two years ago.
"He won't let anyone but me go near him,"
explained his owner, "he bites everyone else.
Each of these horses has worn out five or six of
the English carriage horses that did not have
nearly so hard a life"&mdash;and he explained that
the American horse can do the work of two
hackneys, his legs being as hard as iron.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the old pensioners, (as their master
had never sold a horse that had done him good
service) he showed Joe W., a horse seventeen
hands two inches high, who was nineteen years
old.  He had driven him on the road twelve
years, had raced, and only now retired him because
he was getting old, though his legs were still
perfectly sound and he had never been lame,
except once from an overreach in a race.  He
had not been coddled, but whenever he was
driven on the road, was pelted along at twenty
miles an hour, however hard that road might be.
</p>

<p>
Only the pick of the horses were stabled there&mdash;about
sixty were at a place too far off for Gay to
visit, and she got bewildered when she found that
the stable sheltered scores of horses collected
from all points of the compass&mdash;English hackneys,
American, Russian, and Austrian trotters, polo
ponies, hunters, exhibition leaping horses, and
harness ponies, but Rensslaer did not go in much
for steeplechasing, and for what was done, the boy
who had ridden just now, was responsible.
</p>

<p>
Gay sighed.  What a little heaven to Chris, and
what would not he and that other boy do&mdash;a pair
of dare-devils&mdash;if pitted against each other!  She
dreaded, while she longed for him to know such
bliss, and herein lay her inconsistency&mdash;that she
herself loved horses, was happiest near them, yet
would put a limit to Chris's far greater passion, as
if it were to be measured by rule of thumb!
</p>

<p>
It was in this spirit that she asked Rensslaer to
get him down later, but on no account to let him
and the other boy meet, and Rensslaer laughed,
and promised.  He had already decided on
making Chris a certain offer, and had great hopes
that he might accept it.
</p>

<p>
Resuming their progress, he explained to Gay
that his horses did one thing only&mdash;the trotters
only trotted, the jumpers only jumped, and the
horses went through special courses of medicine,
and special courses of food on a strict system.
To train a horse so that he shall be both heavy
and fit, requires a refinement of training to which
only the Americans have attained, and at Elsinore
the most elaborate system of discipline was
carried out, but in a kindly spirit, and the horse
prepared for the life he had to lead.  He took
her off to the breeding paddocks, that had a lot
of both American ex-champion trotting and "Pace
and Action" mares, and also prize hackney mares,
all with foals by trotters and hackneys, his idea
being to breed, besides racing trotters, for racing
on the Continent, show horses which should have
more speed and quality than the hackney, whilst
retaining their action, and to this end he crossed
the American trotter with the hackney.
</p>

<p>
"If my attempts to improve the English
hackney by giving him some of the pace and
action of the fast trotting horse should be crowned
with success, I shall be satisfied," he told Gay,
and he pointed out a foal that looked like
a thoroughbred, and moved like a trotter with
hackney action.  In fact, most of these cross-bred
foals looked the ideal carriage horse&mdash;good whole
colours, great quality, long necks, very high
action, great speed, and perfect manners, and
there was never any difficulty in breaking them.
Then came an inspection of the racing sulkies,
which had an extra low seat so as to come round
the turns better; then there were the long-shaft
sulkies for a horse who has high action, and
makes the ordinary sulky bob up and down, the
jogging carts for exercising in, and the
four-wheeled, single-seated racing wagons, called
speed wagons, used by gentlemen driving in the
States for Matinée or Amateur Trotting races.
This obviates the necessity of spreading the legs
apart on each side of the horse, and for some
horses this does not diminish their speed, in fact
they can go faster in a wagon than in a sulky, in
spite of the extra weight, as it runs smoother,
and does not hamper them.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer next took Gay to the outdoor training
school, which is specially designed for the education
of jumpers, on the inner side of which was a
platform from which the attendants controlled
them, and she watched them run loose on the
track, jumping heavy tree trunks, fences, and
other obstacles, and if they failed in their riderless
freedom to clear them, they gained experience
in the tumble that ensued, which served them
well later.
</p>

<p>
She was shown how a horse is made familiar
with the trials and the terrors of the road, and is
taught to understand them.  A machine that
makes a noise like a score of motors all going
at once, convinces the animal that the hateful
thing means no danger to him, and quick to take
a hint as his nature is, he approaches with
confidence and freedom the tasks he has to face in
his curriculum, and is soon well-equipped to face
the emergencies of his career.
</p>

<p>
Then followed an extraordinary exhibition of
skill in which Rensslaer was evidently keenly
interested, that consisted in the lassoing of a
supposed vicious horse by long reins held in the
hands of the <i>Haute École</i> rider, so that he is
brought first to one knee, and then another, and
rendered helpless, and the lesson taught him that
force is of no avail against brains and cunning.
</p>

<p>
Gay sighed when at last they left the great
quadrangle, steeped in the peace of the evening
hour, and visited the yard where choice Belgian
griffons and Pomeranians yelped in ecstatic chorus
when Rensslaer approached their kennels&mdash;yet
much as Gay loved dogs, she could not admire
them like the beauties she had just left.  Moreover,
it was growing late, and they entered the house.
</p>

<p>
When she had dug out the Professor, still dead
to the world, and asking nothing better than to
remain dead, they had tea, and departed.
</p>

<p>
"Really a most remarkable individual, my
dear," said the Professor, for a man who could
do all the varied things his host could, and yet
have the brains and taste to collect such books as
the Professor had been gloating over, was not
to be met above once in a lifetime.  "In <i>his</i>
case, success is not due to his wealth."
</p>

<p>
"In spite of it, you mean!" cried Gay.  "If
it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle, than a rich man to enter the kingdom of
heaven, it's a million times more difficult for him
to live his own life, act up to his ideals, and fulfil
the genius that is in him.  The world won't <i>let</i>
him as a rule."
</p>

<p>
"And to think that such a man as that should
keep <i>Trotters</i>!" said the Professor, who, if he
thought at all of what Gay had been doing that
glorious June afternoon, concluded that she had
enthused over something a trifle better than the
weedy specimens he had seen at Waterloo Park.
</p>

<p>
But Gay sat very still, thinking.  She had
found herself admitted to a paradise hitherto
undreamed of; it was as if, seeking a single
diamond, she had found a Golconda, and something
of Chris's passion for horses had been
breathed into her ... they were so much, much
more beautiful than humans, more clever even
in some respects ... with one-half of her soul
she worshipped, with the other half feared them,
as the real rivals to her happiness.
</p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
THE TUG-OF-WAR
</h3>

<p>
Chris looked very white and thin, but just as
smart as ever, and completely unsubdued in
spirit and intention, when he called in Connaught
Square one afternoon late in May, and found
Gay in.
</p>

<p>
She looks prettier than ever, he thought, if
less rounded than of yore, and if he had expressed
sorrow at causing her so much pain, Gay's tender
heart would instantly have melted, but for all his
delight at seeing her, his evident determination to
treat his accident as a trifle not worth talking
about, put her back up to begin with.  And
when he unblushingly asked her to condole with
him on the number of good things he had missed,
and roundly abused the Professor and his understudy,
for refusing him permission to ride with an
arm strapped to his side, Gay's patience gave
way utterly, and the first little rift within the lute
made itself known.
</p>

<p>
Poor Chris felt that coldness in the air, but
had not the key to the puzzle, and he could not
make Gay out.  Instead of the jolly little girl,
eager to hear all about his stable, to discuss his
horses, his hopes and future chances, to buck him
up as she had so often done when things went
wrong, she did not seem to have a word to throw
to him except about trivial matters that didn't in
the least interest him&mdash;or her, formerly.
</p>

<p>
How could he tell that those moments in which
she saw his colours closed in by a mêlée of
struggling horses and men, had changed her from
a careless, happy-go-lucky girl, who laughed at
accidents, had scarcely flung a fear even to
death, to a thoughtful woman whose outlook on
life would never again be quite the same?
In a word, what he did before had not mattered,
but now that she knew she loved him, it <i>did</i>, yet
this solution never occurred to him, nor was there
anything in her manner to suggest it&mdash;quite the
reverse, in fact.
</p>

<p>
He asked her a few questions about her horses,
and what they had done lately, as the papers did
not always chronicle their doings, and she told
him of their failures and successes, quite without
enthusiasm, and Chris came to the conclusion
that experience and Rensslaer combined, had put
her off Trotting.  And if she did not tell him
that her horses were entered for no more fixtures
after the end of June, and that her brief
connection with Trotting would altogether cease on
her return from abroad, Chris saw, clearly enough,
that she took no more interest in the sport into
which she had so light-heartedly plunged, than
she did in his.
</p>

<p>
If hitherto Gay's life had been regulated by a
warm heart, high spirits, and quick wits, he knew
that it was so no longer, and resented the change
in her.  Sunbeams might not fulfil any recognised
place in the scheme of creation, but they were
delightful all the same, and he had been quite
satisfied with her as she was.  If he had only
known it, she loved him at that moment more than
ever, realising now she was with him, how
completely he had spoiled her for everyone else, that
he was the one companion of whom she never
tired, never could tire.
</p>

<p>
"Frank and I are going abroad early in July,"
she said presently, and Chris's face lengthened.
Steeplechasing was over for the year, and until
he began to train his horses at the end of August,
there was only the flat racing he despised, very
seldom took the trouble to look at&mdash;and now
Gay, on whose precious company he had counted,
was going away in a little more than a month.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be riding again till autumn, worse
luck," he said.  "And I'm too late for Olympia."
</p>

<p>
Gay looked at him, half-angry, half-reluctantly
admiring&mdash;here he was, a mere gaunt shadow of
himself, after the worst outing he had ever had,
with only one longing&mdash;to court another!
</p>

<p>
Chris was very sensitive, and his hatred of
talking about himself was only equalled by his
horror of being a bore.  So although the change
in her manner hurt him more than either he or
she knew, he abruptly changed the subject.
</p>

<p>
"You'll let me escort you to your meetings now,
with Lossie, of course," he added grudgingly.
"Tom Bulteel will be jolly glad to be off duty,
I expect."
</p>

<p>
"And Effie too," said Gay candidly.  "She
did detest coming with me so, but they both
played up splendidly, even if Tom's temper has
been perfectly horrid."
</p>

<p>
"And where is this wonderful Gold Vase?"
said Chris, looking at the centre of the carpet as
if he expected to see it installed there as tutelary
god.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hate it!" cried poor Gay, with tears
in her voice.  "It's covered over with a piece of
sackcloth&mdash;I mean silk&mdash;in my den.  It was won
by a fraud&mdash;paid for with Carlton's good name&mdash;the
great mistake was his thinking I'd value
anything bought at such a cost."
</p>

<p>
"He never expected that brute to follow him
up and see the toe-weights trick," said Chris
consolingly.  "Honest men can't play the rogue,
and that's about all there is to it.  Heard from
him lately?"
</p>

<p>
"He is doing a cure at Aix&mdash;for the sake of
the scenery, you know!" she laughed.  "I have
had some cheerful, gossiping letters from him,"
and Chris nodded carelessly, as at a matter of no
interest to either.  Mackrell had played the fool,
and must take the consequences.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a horrid pause&mdash;a pause
between these two who usually chattered like
magpies when they got together!
</p>

<p>
"I made a scrap-book out of the snapshots
and sketches of you," said Chris, rather gravely.
"By a moderate computation there are somewhere
about thirty, and I divided them into
groups&mdash;the decent"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"the&mdash;not
nice&mdash;and the positively libellous."
</p>

<p>
Gay coloured warmly.  If her escapade had
brought her a <i>succès de scandal</i>, caused her to be
surrounded wherever she went in public, and
make acquaintances faster than she wanted, she
knew well enough the subtle difference in men's
manners towards her, since she had courted
publicity.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't such a very awful thing to do,
really," she said, with a rebellious toss of her
red-brown head.  "It was only those spiteful
wretches made it <i>look</i> bad."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather see a picture of you as you look
now," said Chris quietly, and Gay blushed again,
the gentlest of reproofs always hit her hard.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Chris," she said earnestly, "I had
always <i>longed</i> to drive myself&mdash;I had had two
trial spins in private&mdash;and when I saw my driver
was tight at the critical moment, of course I
ought to have asked Mr. Rensslaer to take his
place, but the temptation was too irresistible,
and, of course, I fell."
</p>

<p>
"So, apparently, did one of the competitors,"
said Chris; "broke an arm or leg, didn't he?
So, you see, Trotting people can have accidents
as well as jockeys."
</p>

<p>
Gay reluctantly admitted the fact.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she said, "such a fall may be
anything from a scratched face up to being killed&mdash;one
of Mr. Rensslaer's drivers had just such a
fall, not from hobbles, but from the track being
badly made, and the man did not hurt himself a
bit, but he has known a man killed by it.  Still,
you may say that of every sport.  Take
hunting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord," cried Chris, "don't compare our
national pastime with Trotting, please!"
</p>

<p>
But Gay affected not to hear.  "I can quite
understand a man being fond of riding, or even
of 'riding jolly,'" she said severely.  "Our
forefathers did&mdash;and on considerably more
jumping powder than in these almost Spartan
days&mdash;and it must be a lovely feeling that everything
is plain sailing, that neither you nor your
horse are capable of making a mistake&mdash;in that
heavenly state of mind you do remarkable things
over and over again that you never could do in
cold blood&mdash;but that is quite a different thing to
steeplechasing!"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," agreed Chris in a tone that made
Gay turn away indignantly, thinking of Carlton,
and what he had not hesitated to do for her.
Yes, Chris was certainly doing his best to throw
her into his absent rival's arms, while on the other
hand he was cut to the heart by her reception
of him, so utterly different to the one for which
during long weeks of pain he had longed.
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously, he had looked for a little of that
"mothering" that the best kind of woman knows
how to give the man she loves, when in trouble,
but Chris's pride was more than equal to his
tenderness of heart, and he gave no sign of his
wound.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rensslaer has asked us over to his place
at Vienna&mdash;he is going to let me drive one of his
Trotters for him.  After all," cried Gay, becoming
only the more rebellious under Chris's grave
looks&mdash;Chris the gay-hearted, whom she had confidently
reckoned on to think her right whatever she did&mdash;"why
should a thing that is right in Vienna, be
wrong in England?"
</p>

<p>
"In Rome," murmured Chris vaguely, "you
must do as the 'Rum-uns' do."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Gay impatiently, "we know that
vice and virtue are matters of climate and colour,
that what is right in the east, is wrong in the
west, and it's the same with Trotting&mdash;if I am
satirised in England, I shall make up for it in the
encouragement and respect I shall get abroad!"
</p>

<p>
She jumped up, and fetched some large
photographs that represented an attractive girl
driving one of Rensslaer's trotters, and Chris
mentally compared this modest presentment of a
modest woman, in an elegant conveyance, with
the fiendish cleverness of a sketch representing
Gay perched upon a shining skeleton wagon,
with a charming leg stretched along a shaft on
either side of it.
</p>

<p>
"You're too good for it, Gay," he said, "either
there or here.  Rensslaer is right&mdash;there is no
future for Trotting under present conditions in
England."
</p>

<p>
Gay shrugged her shoulders, and abruptly,
contemptuously even, changed the subject.
</p>

<p>
"I am looking forward tremendously to
Olympia," she said, "aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the jumping will be all right.  I
hear the fences are to be very much higher than
any seen before in other shows in England, that
gentlemen are to ride instead of stable-boys, is
good."
</p>

<p>
There was a note in his voice that made Gay
sigh impatiently, and turn her head away; here
was the ruling idea, strong in death, or what was
very near it.
</p>

<p>
"Rensslaer must have his hands full," said
Chris.  "Awfully decent chap&mdash;he has looked me
up several times."  He did not say that he had
encouraged him, as bringing news of Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's delightful," said she as tea
appeared, and she began to pour it out.  "His
naïveté, his tremendous natural ability, whether
he's revolver-shooting, or writing a play, or
modelling, or driving Trotters, or judging horses,
or nursing a cat, or taking a lot of trouble about
a silly girl like me and my stupid fancies, there's
no one like him!"
</p>

<p>
But Chris was not jealous, though some men
might have misunderstood Gay's intense admiration
of Rensslaer's genius and many-sidedness,
and the pleasure his friendship had clearly brought
into her life.
</p>

<p>
"You know the papers have engaged you to
him?" he said, and thought of an extremely
uncomplimentary snapshot of Rensslaer, crouched
low on his seat, and made ferocious by his huge
goggles, published in the papers side by side
with Gay.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she said incredulously.  "Do you
suppose that a man like that would care for a
silly little ignoramus like me?"
</p>

<p>
"Men hate brains," said Chris grumpily, and
his temper was not improved by being told that
it was only <i>boys</i> who did.
</p>

<p>
"He wants you to go down to Elsinore," said
Gay.  "Oh, Chris, the peace of that great
quadrangle&mdash;the luxury of those stables that yet
compass the most perfect simplicity of service to
those beautiful creatures&mdash;you'll be like a boy in
a sweet-shop, running about from one joy to
another and loth to leave any.  To run through
his hundred or so of horses, will take you
approximately, I should say, a year of
undulterated bliss!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that his stable will interest me
so much," objected Chris.  "You see, he doesn't
go in for steeplechasing&mdash;it's driving he's great at."
</p>

<p>
"Why, he <i>loves</i> his horses," cried Gay
indignantly.  "It's his humanising influence in
the stable&mdash;loving the dear beasts, not for what
they do, and the money to be made out of them,
but for what they <i>are</i>&mdash;that's so lovely."
</p>

<p>
Chris sighed.  To love horses, and live among
the world's pick of them as Rensslaer did, was a
lot that the most fortunate man alive might envy.
</p>

<p>
"Chris?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Lavinia has been a great comfort to me
while you were laid up."  Chris smiled&mdash;it was a
sign of grace in her that she had need of
comforting.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know till she told me&mdash;how&mdash;how
charitable you are.  No wonder you're always
hard up, when you give away most of your
winnings in helping poor, wretched people!"
</p>

<p>
Chris coloured.
</p>

<p>
"I don't," he said.  "Aunt Lavinia has been
pulling your leg."
</p>

<p>
"Has it ever struck you that I am very
selfish?" inquired Gay anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Often&mdash;about not making me happy.  And
it would be so easy, and so&mdash;er&mdash;so pleasant,"
said Chris, with the lines that meant mischief
wrinkling his young eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You know," said Gay hastily, "somehow my
ambitions seem <i>common</i> to me when I look at
that dear little lady, who lives entirely for others,
and I question my right to waste money as I do
on Trotting and otherwise.  Oh, I'm not a
Socialist"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I should hope not," said Chris significantly.
"It just means that you make another man work
for you while you idle, and then curse him because
he does not make enough to give you luxuries."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm idle enough," said Gay remorsefully,
"but I <i>do</i> feel a burning desire to see the rich
enjoy less, and the poor and unfortunate <i>suffer</i>
less, and I know perfectly well that I ought to
sell my horses&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't fetch much," said Chris,
chuckling unkindly.  "But there's nothing I'd
enjoy more than putting 'em up at Tattersall's&mdash;if
they're good enough for Tat's."
</p>

<p>
Gay turned very white, and a flash like steel
came into her grey eyes&mdash;few people had ever
seen it, but it meant mischief.
</p>

<p>
"And I to see you put up yours," she said
quietly.  "When you drop racing, Chris, you
may talk to me about Trotting&mdash;not before."
</p>

<p>
Chris too had turned very pale, he understood
now.  He was to tear out what was in the very
blood and fibre of him&mdash;what had been in
countless generations of his hard-riding, sporting
forefathers...
</p>

<p>
"You ask me for my very life itself," he said
heavily.  "Even my mother never asked me
that impossibility.  She placed my deep
happiness in riding before her own peace of mind
always."
</p>

<p>
Yes, his mother had known how to love him
better than that....  He must possess great
qualities to love, and be so beloved by his mother,
that their love went on, unbroken even by death.
After all, Gay asked herself, was it not <i>she</i> who
was selfish, not he?
</p>

<p>
Had Chris but looked at her in that moment
of insight, of revelation, each might have been
spared much sorrow, but he was staring straight
before him, his face set and stern at the <i>impasse</i>
to which he and Gay had come&mdash;he thought he
knew now the real reason why she had refused
him at the Ffolliott's dance.
</p>

<p>
At that pregnant moment the door opened
slowly, and a timid face came round the corner,
like a rabbit peering from a burrow; since Min
Toplady's visit, the Professor always looked first
to see if Lossie were there, before entering.
</p>

<p>
"Are you alone, my dear?  Ah, only Chris,
I see," and the Professor came forward, and
shook his 'case's' hand warmly.  If only the
boy could be weaned from steeplechasing, there
was no one he would like better for a brother-in-law,
though of course it must be a long&mdash;a very
long engagement.
</p>

<p>
"I wish," he said presently to Chris in his
tactless way, "that you would persuade Gay
to listen to reason, and give up Trotting."
</p>

<p>
"He had better get the whip-hand of <i>himself</i>
before he tries to manage others," cried Gay;
then looking at Chris, white, wasted, invincible
in his weakness, her heart was pierced with
cruel pain.  He looked like slipping through,
without the help of any more accidents, and
what would life be worth to her without him?
</p>

<p>
As she moved to the window, and stood looking
out, she lived again those awful moments at
Sandown, yet when she came back to the two
men, her face told nothing, for if Chris had
pluck, she had grit, and the latter wears best
in the long run.
</p>

<p>
"Each to its own, Heron," she said&mdash;"you
to your books and microscope, Chris to his
racers, and I to my Trotters; there isn't a
pin to choose between the selfishness of any one
or us!"
</p>

<p>
And Chris, when presently he said good-bye,
thought grimly that she was about right.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
CARLTON'S "LITTLE BILL"
</h3>

<p>
It was characteristic of Carlton Mackrell that he
should turn up unexpectedly in the Park one
afternoon, looking his usual unruffled self, and
greet the little party sitting under a tree, as if he
had only parted from them a few hours earlier.
</p>

<p>
No thought of the presentation of his "little
bill" cooled the warmth of Gay's welcome;
Lossie paid him the tribute of nearly fainting
from excess of joy, while Chris, who knew his
only real rival with Gay to be his own passion for
steeplechasing, was cordiality itself.
</p>

<p>
It was one of the few sunny afternoons in a
summer that was the very abomination of
desolation, and Carlton, who looked very brown and
well, was clearly glad to be back in the world&mdash;his
world, that never enthused, or got excited, or
asked questions, but took everything for granted
in its own delightful way.  He liked its indifference
to the non-essentials of social intercourse, its
tranquility and spacious forgiving humours, its
freedom from conventions, and disdain for little
things&mdash;yes, with all its charms and vices, English
society alone had the art of life.  Even Rensslaer,
who was a cosmopolitan in his tastes and habits,
had once admitted to Carlton that he had made
his home in England because, as he frankly
confessed, London had his heart.
</p>

<p>
"When I am here, I always feel that I am at
the centre of things&mdash;right at the heart of all
there's happening," he said.  "You don't feel
this in any other city in the world&mdash;but London
is the whole world itself, squeezed into a few
square miles."
</p>

<p>
Gay, if she were nervous, did not suffer it to
appear, but chaffed Carlton mercilessly about his
rheumatism, inquiring if he had found its cure
at the Aix gaming tables, and in those <i>dolce far
niente</i> drives on the old Roman roads that she
herself adored.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, looking very happy, and very
handsome&mdash;indeed the quartette were in such
high spirits, and of such conspicuous good looks,
as to attract an unusual amount of attention,
Gay heard one woman murmur in passing them,
"three angels&mdash;and an Immortal," the latter with
a glance at Chris that sent a pang to her heart.
</p>

<p>
Carlton was genuinely shocked at Chris's looks
(for which Gay was almost as much responsible
as his accident), but delighted to find that there
was no understanding between the two.  Daily
during his stay abroad he had expected to hear
the news of their engagement, and if nothing had
happened in all these weeks, well, the presumption
was, that nothing would.
</p>

<p>
It wanted a good week to the Horse Show;
town was at its very best, and Gay, who was
always restless now, gave her whole mind to
frivolity, greatly to Lossie's delight.  The four
young people filled the days, and the greater
part of their nights, with amusements of every
kind, so that, as the Professor declared, Gay only
used her house to sleep in, seldom to feed.
</p>

<p>
With two of the party happy, for Lossie was
in triumphant beauty, and quite satisfied at the
way things were going, and the other two playing
up brilliantly, they made the gayest possible
quartette, and more than once, either as host or
guest, Rensslaer joined them, to Gay's manifest
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
It was not surprising that Carlton quite wrongly
attributed Gay's welcome change of front about
trotting, to Rensslaer's influence, for although that
sport was the one tabooed subject with them all,
he knew from Tugwood, who had insisted on
keeping him well posted, that she seldom took
the trouble to see her horses run now.
</p>

<p>
But he was equally correct in thinking that
her friendship with Rensslaer had developed a
side of her character that up to now, no one
had been aware of, and with some mortification
realised, that neither he nor Chris had
allowed for the spirituality that is in every
woman worthy of the name, and that Rensslaer
so fully recognised.
</p>

<p>
While just as original, Gay had wider sympathies,
read more, thought more, and that she
had a very genuine and even warm affection for
Rensslaer, no one could doubt who saw them
together.  She displayed an eager pleasure when
they met, that neither of the two younger men
by any means evoked&mdash;it happened, therefore,
that Carlton came to entirely misunderstand the
position, be as certain that the man was in
love with Gay (for a lover always thinks the
whole world is in league to want what he wants),
as he suspected Gay, out of sheer perversity, to
fancy herself in love with Rensslaer.
</p>

<p>
With men of Carlton Mackrell's type and
position, brains are never admitted, or if
possessed, they are sedulously hidden&mdash;it would
be bad form, make uncomfortable other men to
use them, and he had never seriously considered
their value till now, when he saw the mental
hold that Rensslaer had taken on her.  But the
more complex a man is, the better he likes a
woman to be purely normal, and like Chris,
Carlton by no means approved of the change in
Gay.
</p>

<p>
He thought of the sweet perfume of the wild
hawthorn, of how the cultivated, double variety,
beautiful in shape and colour though it may be,
has none, and he missed the wildness and
spontaneity, yes, and the wilfulness that he loved in
Gay, and longed to have it back again.
</p>

<p>
It was curious with what jealous iteration
in conversation between Carlton and Lossie,
Rensslaer's name cropped up, and that the man
should display such incredible blindness to the
real position of affairs between Gay and Chris,
appealed to Lossie's sense of humour.  She only
bided her time to undeceive him, and the
opportunity came at Ranelagh on the Saturday
preceding the opening of the Horse Show, when
somehow the two couples had got separated, as
often happened.  It was a significant fact which
seemed altogether to escape Carlton, that uneasy
as Gay and Chris seemed to be when together,
it was impossible to keep them apart.
</p>

<p>
Sitting under the trees, Carlton and Lossie
talked trifles till, as was inevitable, Rensslaer's
(to Carlton) abhorred personality intruded, and
the reason of his influence over Gay was debated.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see his charm," said Carlton,
who, like many other very handsome men, quite
unconsciously exaggerated the power of good
looks over women.
</p>

<p>
"He's got a mind," said Lossie significantly,
"and that lasts longest in the long run."
</p>

<p>
"So has Gay," said Carlton, "and that is the
<i>point d'appui</i> between them.  She could never
put up with poor Hannen, who has but one idea
in his head&mdash;horses."
</p>

<p>
"He has one other," she said quietly&mdash;"Gay.
And Gay has only one&mdash;Chris."
</p>

<p>
A red flush showed under Carlton's dark skin,
and he looked at Lossie sharply, suspecting her
of playing her own game, but if there is one thing
more than another that confounds a man, it is the
purity of the outline of a woman's cheek, as
opposed to the deep artifice and dissimulation of
her soul.
</p>

<p>
"They are <i>à tort et à travers</i>!" he exclaimed.
"It's only because there is no steeplechasing on,
and Hannen is at a loose end, that he sticks it."
</p>

<p>
"She would marry him to-morrow if he would
give up racing," said Lossie, "and he won't.
Neither will give way&mdash;and there's the rub.
And she's a fool," she added softly, "for a
woman who loves, loves to submit."
</p>

<p>
"Gay won't," said Carlton, as he returned
Lossie's gaze full.  Good Heavens! how lovely
she was, with her forget-me-not eyes, and silky
masses of blue-black hair, framed in a wonderful
hat and gown of royal purplish-blue chiffon, that
would have killed most women.  He wondered
that Rensslaer had passed her by for Gay; for
himself, of course, it was different&mdash;he knew Gay's
good qualities so well, her disposition inside out.
</p>

<p>
"Gay has a will of her own," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And a heart," said Lossie significantly, "that
runs away with her head.  You see, Chris looks
so ill, and you so&mdash;so provokingly <i>well</i>&mdash;"  Her
gaze lingered on his face warmly like a caress,
and indeed he was very good to look at.
"There's something awfully maternal about Gay&mdash;not
to say 'sloppy'&mdash;wanting to help everyone,
like silly Aunt Lavinia, you know.  It makes you
so cheap," she addedly rashly, and saw her
mistake when Carlton, who liked Lavinia&mdash;as
who did not?&mdash;frowned, and suggested that they
should join the others.
</p>

<p>
They found them silently looking on at a game
of polo&mdash;if there were a horse anywhere near,
Chris gravitated naturally towards it&mdash;and for a
while they discussed the players and the cattle.
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Hannen will see better at Elsinore
to-morrow," Gay said to Carlton a little nervously.
Each day, each hour seemed to bring nearer to
her the presentation of that "little bill," and there
was a dangerous spark in his eye that foretold
trouble in the near future.  Indeed, as they stood
quietly chatting about the wonders of Elsinore,
Carlton suddenly realised that Lossie had told
him the truth, and with a mad, hot rush of
jealousy, that for the moment blinded him to all
sense of honour, he inly swore that he would
obtain Gay at all hazards, her love for Chris
notwithstanding, using the steeplechase difficulty
as a means of accomplishing his desires.
</p>

<p>
Lossie, reading him like a book, felt her heart
sink.  Yet, after all, would it not be better when
he had put his fate to the touch, and realised once
for all that Gay was not for him?  He would
take it badly&mdash;very badly.  He would go away
again, but some day he would come back&mdash;and
even if he knew that she loved him, Lossie had
not committed the one sin that to a man is
unpardonable, the sin of boring him.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
A <i>MODUS VIVENDI</i>
</h3>

<p>
Chris returned from Elsinore decidedly quiet,
not to say subdued in manner.  Gay thought it
was because in the enchanted world of horses he
had entered there, the steeplechaser found his
true level, was only one of many, not the be-all
and end-all of existence; she also concluded that
Rensslaer had kept the dare-devil young rider,
who had given Gay a taste of his jumping
capacity, out of sight, as indeed he had.  Oddly
enough, Chris seemed more struck with Rensslaer's
personality and marvellous shooting, than anything
else, and waxed eloquent when he reported to
Gay at dinner that night, all he had seen and
done during the day.
</p>

<p>
"He's a fine chap," said Chris, "and a good
sportsman&mdash;does some good with <i>his</i> money.
By Jove! you should just see him shoot on
horseback!  He's out of his element, an
anachronism, in the garb of civilisation, but in his
shirt and breeches, he's an athlete, and a model of
skill and strength, while his mare is a marvel.  I
followed at a distance on a pony, and to see
him drop a stag with a right and left, is a
caution."
</p>

<p>
He happened as he spoke to catch the eye of
the Professor, who stiffened visibly.
</p>

<p>
"Dangerous things, firearms," he said.  "I
never have anything to do with them myself, and
as to shooting on horseback, I told you once
before, at the Ffolliott's dance, I think&mdash;that while
a good horseman in my youth, ahem! my riding
days are now over."
</p>

<p>
The Ffolliott's dance ... the hectic of
excitement sank in Chris's hollow cheeks ... how
long ago it seemed ... and a dear little girl
faltering out that she wanted time ... crying
her youth ... when all the while she had made
up her mind not to marry him because he loved
horses too well; yet how adorable she had been,
how different from the little shrew who was
looking angrily at him at that moment!
</p>

<p>
Yet poor Gay thought she had some reason
for complaint.  Was his talk never to be of
anything but sport in one form or another?
Rensslaer the artist, appealed to her much more
than Rensslaer the champion shot ... and then
her thoughts went off with apparent, but not
real, inconsequence to Carlton Mackrell, whose
aimless, pleasant life had always annoyed her, but
who had yet proved himself capable of a romantic
action for which few would have given him credit,
as few would themselves have committed it.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs, after dinner, it was no better.
</p>

<p>
There was the fresh, bright room with its
heaps of flowers, just the same as ever; there was
Gay, prettier than ever, but no longer the bright
mortal whom one of her friends had christened
"radium," so continually did she carry
sunshine about with her.  There was little enough
warmth in the eyes that met Chris's, and how was
he to know that it was only by a violent effort
she curbed the longing to put out her hand, and
touch the sunny head so near her own?
</p>

<p>
He too was changed.  Formerly nothing had
been a trouble, and nobody was a bore; he
simply lived to please those he loved, and of
these Gay was chiefest, but ill-health probably,
and heartache certainly, were ruining his temper
and his disposition for the time being.  He thought
Gay very hard on him, and she thought him hard
on himself&mdash;as did Aunt Lavinia.
</p>

<p>
Presently Chris sprang up, feeling that he
could bear it no longer, and pleading that he was
tired with his long day at Elsinore, he left early
for Epsom, with more to think of than Gay
guessed, and dispirited to a degree she had no
idea of, or perhaps she would have bid him
good-bye more kindly.
</p>

<p>
As he thought of the once cheery little comrade
who in former days had been wont to accompany
him downstairs, the chilly aloofness of her struck
Chris to the heart, though what of Gay, who was
already in her own room, weeping passionately,
when the slam of the hall-door came?
</p>

<p>
"If his mother could see me," she thought,
and almost looked round for invisible whips.
</p>

<p>
In the train Chris recalled his quiet chat with
Rensslaer before leaving Elsinore, the latter
having thrown out a word of inquiry as to his
future plans, and Chris had lightly sketched his
autumn programme&mdash;a sufficiently full one.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer had listened with attention, then
said:
</p>

<p>
"There's no money to be made at racing as
you practice it&mdash;the surroundings are not healthy,
either morally or physically&mdash;there is too much
excitement, too much bodily waste.  It may
wreck your manhood in the long run&mdash;you weigh
a couple of stone less than you ought&mdash;and"&mdash;Rensslaer
hesitated&mdash;"it's not fair to Miss Gay."
</p>

<p>
"It's my very life, sir," cried Chris warmly.
</p>

<p>
"In short," said Rensslaer, and smiled,
"Bagehot knew what he was talking about, when
he said that the 'natural impulse of the English
people is to resist authority.'  What you want is
discipline."
</p>

<p>
Chris uttered an exclamation, and his eyes
flashed, for as he took no liberty with others, so
he allowed none to be taken with him, but
Rensslaer took no notice.
</p>

<p>
"I am old enough to be your father," he said;
"let me for once speak to you as one.  The
fault of your character is not so much want of
purpose, as the need of one worthy of you&mdash;bend
those talents which I know you to possess to
some definite object, and embark without further
delay on some worthy career.  What you want
is <i>work</i>, which is the salt of existence; the
pleasure you take in horses should be for
moments of relaxation&mdash;a refreshing pause to
make your step all the quicker, your mind all
the more braced for the serious business of life."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't call the job of schooling and
making horses exactly a sinecure," said Chris
coldly.  "I have work enough and to spare, and
it is the work that I love."
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"It is because you love it so well that it's play,
and it leads nowhere&mdash;except over broken
hearts," he added in a lower tone, and Chris
winced.  "Did you see what that German who
has lived for thirty years in England says about
the deterioration in English character?  He
speaks of that increasing section of our people,
whose guiding principle in life gives the lie to
that strenuous rule of sturdy self-denial, and
initiative, on which our Empire was founded, and
by which alone it can be preserved."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose no one will deny that there's
plenty of self-denial in my profession," said
Chris drily.
</p>

<p>
"As I said before, you do it for your own
pleasure," said Rensslaer gravely, "and to others'
sorrow.  Whether you merely kill, or only
mangle yourself, it's self-indulgence pure and
simple.  Discipline, self-sacrifice for the State's
sake, are the qualities that the modern Englishman
needs to cultivate.  But I'm afraid that
selfishness, and an inordinate love of pleasure,
with a corresponding contempt for, and hatred of
all that savours of restraint, are the prevailing
characteristics of the heirs to the most Imperial
inheritance that history has ever known."
</p>

<p>
"And by the State," said Chris quietly, but
inwardly furious at having to import Gay's
name into the discussion, "I presume you
mean Miss Lawless&mdash;to whom I am not doing
my duty?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Be my land-agent," said Rensslaer
abruptly.  "There will be a lot of hard work about
it, and you'll have to learn the business, but on
the other hand, you can have the pick of my
stable for riding and driving in the ordinary
way&mdash;no 'schooling,' which is just as dangerous as
steeplechasing, but as much hunting as you choose.
If you would think a thousand a year sufficient&mdash;and
there is a really charming house on the estate
that I feel sure Miss Gay would like&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You take it for granted Miss Gay would care
too," said Chris, the thunder-cloud leaving his
brow.  "Thank you, sir.  It's most awfully good
of you&mdash;and I know more on Miss Lawless's
account than mine&mdash;but it's an offer I can't
possibly accept."
</p>

<p>
Yet if Gay were not positively brutal to him
nowadays (or so poor Chris expressed it) he
would have felt more remorse at throwing away
her happiness, and, his passion for horses
notwithstanding, what his better self told him
was his happiness also.
</p>

<p>
Deeply disappointed as his host was, he said
no more, and that Chris was so enthusiastic
about him to Gay, showed that they had parted
the best of friends.  Indeed, the boy's sunny
good humour, the incorrigible pluck and charm
of him, the blending of heart and breeding, and taste,
of all those qualities, in short, that go to make in
the real sense of the word, a gentleman, had long
ago endeared him to Rensslaer, as to all others.
</p>

<p>
But the spirit of perversity that had seized
Chris when he last dined at Connaught Square
throve apace, and he made no effort to dislodge it;
whatever he did, or did not do, he could not please
Gay.  He had deliberately talked shooting to
her, that he might keep his tongue off the
raptures of admiration into which Rensslaer's
stable had plunged him, and that was wrong&mdash;like
everything else.
</p>

<p>
Well, if she wanted a lady-like fool, who took
no risks, to play round with&mdash;for thus he rudely
designated Carlton&mdash;she had better take him, and
the sooner the better.  Chris's usual good manners
were going by the board under the strain of
mingled ill-health, and mental irritation combined,
and altogether he was in a very bad way indeed,
when on the day before the Horse Show, he went
to see Aunt Lavinia, whom he had somewhat
neglected since his recovery.
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy!" she exclaimed in delight as she
got up from her writing-table, "how nice you
look, and how <i>lean</i>!"&mdash;for she could not abide fat
on a man&mdash;and she kissed him fondly.
</p>

<p>
Chris's bright hair, his smile, and general
smartness stood him in excellent stead on all
occasions when he wished to hide his real
feelings, but Lavinia knew him very well, and
after some talk, and the transference of a small
cheque to her for her poor, the little lady roundly
taxed him with having something on his mind.
</p>

<p>
"Too much money," said Chris, and chuckled.
"Are you going to Olympia?  We have all been
buying tickets on our own&mdash;Rensslaer, Mackrell,
Bulteel, and myself&mdash;and it seems to me, between
us all, we can live there the whole week if we like,
with intervals for food and sleep."
</p>

<p>
"It's out of my line, Laddie," she said, "even
if it did not mean a new frock&mdash;which would
make me miserable.  But it will be a pretty
sight.  Is it because you are not riding, you
have the hump?" she added, looking at him
shrewdly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I should like it," said Chris, "but
there are lots of other fellows who will do it
better, of course."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to be a rule of life," she said, "that
one can only be happy at the cost of others'
unhappiness&mdash;and your disappointment probably
means that Gay is happy."
</p>

<p>
"I think it would take a lot to make her that
nowadays," he said drily.  "But isn't it a pretty
rotten world when such a state of things prevails,
that we are afraid to even admit that we are
happy&mdash;and rub a piece of wood to give our
admission the lie?"
</p>

<p>
"There are so many ways of happiness," she
said, "but practically only one of misery.  There's
self-control, Laddie"&mdash;she hesitated, and glanced
at the boy's handsome head, a little bent already in
anticipation of rebuke&mdash;"what is life, after all,
but discipline?"
</p>

<p>
Chris thought that Rensslaer, as well as Gay,
must have been getting at her, and turned
restive&mdash;there seemed no comfort for him
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you say all this to Mackrell?
He deserves it quite as much as I do.  He never
does anything but what he likes; he doesn't even
break his bones."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my boy," she said sadly, "it is only these
we love, that we take trouble about, and there's
sterner, deeper stuff in you than poor Carlton;
besides, Gay loves you, not him."
</p>

<p>
Chris walked to the window, and stood for a
while, looking out.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Laddie," said Lavinia softly, "you are
fighting for prizes that when obtained are utterly
valueless, for victories more fatal than the most
inglorious defeats, and all because you have not
the strength of mind to break away, to assert
your will-power.  Nothing in this world can
remain stationary&mdash;if you are not improving, you
are going back&mdash;and don't you suppose that she
knows it?  For there is no death," she added
softly; "she is living, but not here&mdash;is listening
to us at this moment, for all we know."
</p>

<p>
"She always hated my riding," he said, and in
those painful, heart-searching moments, realised
that often the real influence of an unselfish life
does not begin till it is over.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia said not one word, only looked at him
with the dear blue eyes in which life, its sins, its
virtues, its passions had been transmuted into a
pure and utterly comprehending humanity, and
at something in his face, not so much unyielding
as unconquerable, because quite beyond his control,
she sighed deeply.  She had seen the struggle so
often, and it had always ended in the one way.
</p>

<p>
There rang in her ears Gay's cry the day before,
</p>

<p>
"Oh! why is it that we love best those who
have never done <i>anything</i> for us&mdash;have even cost
us much sorrow&mdash;and are cruel and ungrateful to
those who have sacrificed themselves for us&mdash;as
Carlton has for me?"
</p>

<p>
Lavinia knew that Gay was in a dangerous
mood, and in a moment of impulse and anger
against Chris's selfishness, might wreck her own,
and two men's lives.  She had a temper, and a
will of her own, and a generous heart also, that
could not fail to appreciate a delicacy that with
Carlton was as great as his devotion.  Yet Chris
did not look the sort of lover that any girl would
turn her back on, when he kissed Lavinia and
departed.
</p>

<p>
"When the Horse Show is over," he said to
himself, with a sense of relief at the postponement
of the struggle, then he would fight out the
burning question of which he could best live
without&mdash;steeplechasing or Gay.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
THE EPIC OF THE HORSE
</h3>

<p>
Rensslaer had taken half-a-dozen tickets for the
Royal day, and any special shows that he thought
would appeal to Gay.  Tom Bulteel had liberally
provided for the Harness classes, Carlton had
concentrated on the Trotting, Chris on the
jumping, which came last in the evening, so that
the united tickets practically covered everything
worth seeing at Olympia.
</p>

<p>
The little party, Gay, Effie, and Tom Bulteel
(save when the latter were at Epsom), Lossie,
Chris, and Carlton, took the Show easily, like a
picnic, saw most of the good things, and missed
those not so good, though when the jumping was
on, Chris remained glued to his seat, deaf, blind,
and oblivious to all around him, save what was
passing in the arena.
</p>

<p>
The Professor had been invited, but declined&mdash;to
the immense relief of everybody, as his squeals
might have astounded the neighbours during the
high jumping.  Gay found it delightful not to
have to be told after squeezing in (as happened
to many other of her friends), that their cards
admitted them to the building only, and seats
must be booked inside, of which there were none
to be booked.
</p>

<p>
The stables amused her immensely.  She
thought it must have astonished the cart horses
to find themselves ensconced between draperies
of crimson and gold, others in a delicate shade of
pearly blue, with huge baskets of flowers floating
over their heads, or in bowers of hothouse blooms,
and upholstered in green and white&mdash;the whole
scheme changed to a royal blue on the day of the
King's visit.  The woodwork of Rensslaer's
boxes was plainly but handsomely covered in
cloth, while each horse's name and its record
appeared over its stall in an ornamental gilt frame.
</p>

<p>
Several of the Continental army officers in
their bright uniforms strolled between the arena
and the stables, chatting and keeping an eye
on their splendid mounts, and Gay noted approvingly
that these men seemed to be the personal
friends of their horses.  The tall, clean-limbed
animals, although they treated the stablemen
with contempt, pricked up their ears, and thrust
their proudly-poised heads over the stall doors,
every time one of the well-known uniforms came near.
</p>

<p>
It was a quaint sight to see the women in
their delicate summer gowns walking past
the stalls over the dusty asphalt floors, and
peering into the horse-boxes, for an extraordinary
number of women were present, every one of
whom had apparently put on her costliest clothes
for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the Epsom Meeting was not
over, appeared to have no effect on the attendance,
for faces well-known in the world of sport
were to be seen&mdash;it was an "indoor Ascot"&mdash;Ascot
Cup Day so far as the dresses were concerned,
mingled with the paddock on Derby
Day, with its multiplicity of languages&mdash;Ascot
with magnificent horses, and instead of racing on
the flat, jumping, trotting, and tandem driving.
</p>

<p>
The gowns showed fairly well in the Ambassadors
and other boxes, but Lossie justly complained
that it was like a too dense wood, where you can't
admire the foliage for the trees, and that every
woman requires a special clearing to herself to be
shown off properly, which she certainly had not
here.
</p>

<p>
Yet Lossie herself easily made her presence
felt in the immediate vicinity, and drew many an
envious glance on her exquisite harmony in
blue, and bluer eyes, though Gay's frock of
white worked muslin, with a great cluster of
crimson roses at her girlish breast, appealed to
both Carlton and Chris far more.
</p>

<p>
But as usual in the quartette made by the
young people, it was to Lossie that Carlton fell,
and very content and lovely the girl looked as she
sat beside him, while on his part, he did not find
it difficult to make himself pleasant to her, even if
Gay apparently had forgotten her quarrel with
Chris, laughed, and was happy.  The two criticised
everything, and discussed with zest the charming
<i>coup d'œil</i> presented, which was vivid, and full of
interest, life and colour.
</p>

<p>
Overhead, the rays of the sun streamed through
the glass roof, and were caught by the festoons
and panels, ornamented with the flags and heraldry
that emphasised the international nature of the
show; roses in long, drooping curves connected
the chief parts of the ornamentation, so that
there was not one bare, unsightly piece of
woodwork in all the vast building to offend the eye,
and beneath, the Belgian landscape gardeners
had worked marvels, creating a veritable fairyland
of delight.
</p>

<p>
May trees in full blossom, a fresh green lawn,
flower-beds, shrubs, everything possible to banish
the show-ring, if scarcely to suggest the paddock
or hunting-field, had been done, and beyond
a ring banked with marguerites and scarlet
geraniums, rose row upon row, English, French,
Belgian, and American women, tiny splashes of
colour that mostly represented the hopes and
fears, impending pride or disappointment in the
horsemen who competed for their countries'
honour.
</p>

<p>
The pink hunting-coats or uniforms of the
riders, the picturesque dress of the attendants,
and the sleek, shining horses, all blended into a
picture perfectly harmonious in tone, while the
black coats of the little group of tall, well-bred
men in the arena who acted as judges, somehow
struck a note of distinction in the midst of the
uniforms, and the gay kaleidoscopic surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Horse shows in England are apt to be too
leisurely entertainments&mdash;this was too rapid for
many spectators, for the expedition with which
everything was carried out in the ring, was a
revelation in expert management.  Seeing that
in one jumping class there were a hundred and
twenty entries, it was clear that only by the
full-tilt methods of the old tournament, could the
events be carried through in time, so when one
competition was over, a blast on the coach-horn,
and, hey presto! the great doors at the end of the
hall flew open, and in swept the next competitors,
and jumping or other apparatus vanished as if by
magic.  There was a neatness and despatch about
the whole affair that made the show go as quickly
as a well-arranged theatrical performance, though
the noise caused by the joint efforts of Lord
Lonsdale's band, and the liveried youth in the
ring occasionally provoked some amusement.
</p>

<p>
The vivacity of the scene was undeniable, but
Gay, like many others, experienced the greatest
difficulty in identifying any particular competition
when two or more classes were in the ring, and
when afterwards she tried to remember the right
sequence of the things that most delighted her,
she was not able to, so rapidly had they succeeded
each other.  She remembered vividly Rensslaer's
beautiful little Peter and Mary, under eleven
hands, and to her one of the prettiest sights was
when a tiny Shetland pony only seventeen inches
high, took a prize in a class with big horses,
quality, not quantity, winning, the attendant
having to kneel down to pin the rosette on the
tiny creature.
</p>

<p>
The tandem teams that moved like clockwork
delighted her, and she shared Chris's admiration
for the Stansfield Cottin Battak ponies, that bred
in Sumatra, with handsome heads set on high-crested
necks, full of spirit, and simply balls of
muscle, had all the fire and beauty conferred by
the Arab strain, together with the hardness and
endurance of the Battak breed, the description
"miniature Arabs, with more bone than their
ancestors" fitting them exactly.
</p>

<p>
She loved the magnificent team of Suffolk
Punches that appeared precisely as they do in
the field, in harness adopted from all time by
Suffolk agriculturists, drawing an old-fashioned
Suffolk wagon, while the fact that they were led
by men in smock frocks instead of being driven,
and thus perfectly in character, and representative
of "Old England," appealed strongly to the
public, who cheered them to the echo.
</p>

<p>
With perfect simplicity the Suffolk farm hands
demonstrated how heavy horses harnessed in
twos, may be made to wheel in mazy figures by
just talking to them.  In true old country style,
the man walking beside the leading animal,
shouted in broad Suffolk his commands to him,
"t'other waa," and "th' iver waa" (my way), the
man walking beside the third horse repeating the
commands, and at every order, round came the
four in perfect style, not a hand on their harness
to steady or lead them, wheeling their great
wagon in wonderful evolutions, amid thunders of
applause that would not be silenced.
</p>

<p>
From the horse-lover's point of view, the
horses for mail and other phaetons was a
noteworthy event, and closely watched by Tom
Bulteel.
</p>

<p>
A most stirring competition of the nation was
seen in the pairs.  Mr. Vanderbilt entered three
teams; Rensslaer drove his own horses, and the
French appointments, for which 50 per cent. of
the marks are given, were extremely smart.
Such a show of pairs, or anything like it, had
never been collected in any ring; indeed, said
the experts, never had so perfect a class been
brought together, and the work of the judges
was herculean.  The excitement was intense
as the twenty-two were reduced to a select
eight, including two of Rensslaer's, two of
Mr. Vanderbilt's, and one of Mr. Bates'.
</p>

<p>
Lossie ever after viewed Rensslaer with more
respect as the owner of the superb pair of
carriage horses, named after a couple of popular
sporting peers, that never appeared without
creating a furore of admiration&mdash;she would
above all things have liked them for her own,
and Carlton to sit with her behind them.
</p>

<p>
He on his part viewed them with indifference,
but gave unstinted praise to the class for American
Trotters with records of 2.30 or better; fleet as
Atlanta, slenderly beautiful as greyhounds, they
were a revelation to him of what a horse could
look and be, and he and Gay laughed heartily
as they compared them with the quadrupeds that
in all seriousness they had called Trotters, and
he understood better now Rensslaer's prejudice
against the sport as practised in England.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed Chris, "he <i>can</i> drive!"
as Rensslaer, for some time last of the competitors,
crept up to the front, Storm Cloud beating them
by the way he went round the very small turns
at top speed, passing Sensation, and thus forcing
the other to a break, and afterwards, when he had
won, being driven round at full speed with his
checker-rein, and over-draw bit taken off, so as to
show what manners he had.
</p>

<p>
This was the same horse that displayed great
speed in a pair in the parade before the King,
being the only pair capable of taking their turns
fast.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Gay decided <i>that</i> was her favourite day,
when the sweetest and loveliest lady in all the land,
sat with the King in the Royal box, and frankly
showed her love for horses by the delight she
evinced in their performances, and the frequent
applause she gave them, laughing as heartily as
Gay did, at the humours of the donkeys in the
coster's show.
</p>

<p>
As if in answer to Tom Bulteel's pertinent
remark that the saddle classes could not be
satisfactorily judged, unless the judges took a
turn in the saddle, one of them, himself a
consummate horseman, rode the chargers in turn to
judge of their capacities, and the public applauded
loudly when he mounted Rensslaer's bay roan
gelding, a charger so perfectly trained in the
pretty action and deportment of the <i>Haute École</i>,
that it performed a step-dance with all the
precision possible in a creature with four legs.
</p>

<p>
Gay declared that horses, like children, have
an inborn tendency to dance to the sound of
music&mdash;<i>not</i> horses trained to the <i>Haute École</i>
either&mdash;and that in their grace and tapering limbs,
they made her think of some exquisite exponents
of the ballet, as compared with the unwieldy bodies
and heavy legs of ordinary clumsy human beings.
</p>

<p>
It interested Gay to watch these men, the
keenest judges of horse-flesh, and riding and
driving in the world, who chatted quietly, nodded
appreciatively now and then, criticised, admired,
condemned, evincing no concern when a
frightened horse scattered them to right and
left.  She was greatly amused at a big, striding
bay horse named "Teetotaler" that, though
built on galloping lines, proved himself inferior
to "Whisky," who made short work of his
opponent in the 15 stone class; then there
was a Belgian horse named "Timber-topper"
that thoroughly lived up to his name.
</p>

<p>
Tom Bulteel found much to admire in the horse
and gig class, a purely American affair, that being
rather a novelty in this country, was greatly
approved, but laughed heartily when, in a
four-in-hand class, the coachman had to have
assistance to turn his leaders in the ring.
He naturally took keen interest in the park
teams, which, supported by the Four-in-hand
and Coaching Clubs, by private individuals and
professionals, ensured the judging being watched
with the closest attention.  Then there were
Mr. Vanderbilt's famous team of greys, which he
drove himself, though it was only by a shade
that he wrested the prize from the well-known
browns of the Old Brighton Coach&mdash;an
English turn-out that gradually absorbed most
of the audience's attention, and whose driver,
though he lost the blue rosette, was greeted
with loud and prolonged applause.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your motor-car now?" cried Gay
triumphantly to Lossie.  "Talk of a chauffeur
indeed&mdash;as if his finest, most daring and sustained
feat, could rival the sympathetic dexterity shown
a hundred times here by English and American
whips!"
</p>

<p>
"Just as no rivalry between mechanical
contrivances can hold a candle to the struggle
among the field of beautiful high-bred horses,
sweeping over the turf towards the winning-post,"
said Chris, "for in the mechanical contrivance,
the driver is the only sentient element,
in horse-racing there is both horse and jockey
to reckon with, and the animal enters into
the spirit of the contest just as keenly as his
rider."
</p>

<p>
Inconsistent Gay frowned, and turned her
head away, devoting herself to Tom Bulteel,
who did not want her.  He was intently
watching the class for a quick change of
four-in-hands, marks being given for the speed and
swiftness with which the harnessing and
unharnessing was managed, as well as for the
eight horses and the horsemanship, and some
extraordinarily smart work was being done,
which he fully appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Effie, watching the game, sighed, for Gay's
spirits and temper varied with every succeeding
hour, the "class" witnessed, being the barometer
by which her emotions were set.  When there
was only driving, and Chris's attention entirely
given to her, she sparkled, and was happy;
when jumping was on, and he became absolutely
engrossed in his favourite passion, leaning
forward, his soul in his eyes, and his eyes
where his body panted to be, Gay existed no
more for him than that vast circle of spectators
of which he formed a part, and her brightness was
eclipsed.  Then Carlton scored&mdash;he had not
watched Gay and her attitude towards Chris
during the progress of the Show for nothing, and
each day saw his hopes rise higher, Lossie's fell.
</p>

<p>
To Effie, who was a shrewd observer, this was
something more than a great Horse Show, it was
the picturesque <i>mise en scène</i> for the playing out
of the comedy (or tragedy) of four lives, and of
which she, and unhappy Lossie clearly foresaw the
end....  Chris and wilful Gay were throwing
away their happiness with both hands, and much
as she loved them both, she was powerless
to prevent it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
LOVE OR STEEPLECHASING?
</h3>

<p>
Chris's enjoyment reached perhaps its culminating
point in the round-the-course jumping competition,
that took the place of the high jump&mdash;a real
good, stiff and varied steeplechase.  He noted
keenly the solidity of the obstacles&mdash;post and
rails, park-palings, high park gates, and
push-over gate, a Suffolk "squeeze," with a barrier
of high hedges and thorns; a bank, both abrupt
and sloping; a Leicestershire bullfinch, and the
novelty of the Continental triple bar, consisting
of three high bamboo bars on movable trestles.
</p>

<p>
These could be arranged at any required
distance from one another, which meant that
the horses had to clear a good 20 feet.  Then
there was the celebrated sheep-pen jump, in
which the rider had to leap into the pen, and out
on the other side, the finish and most difficult
feat being the bank, which was a turfed embankment
of five feet high, the horse having to leap,
not over it, but on top of it, and descend the
slope on the other side.
</p>

<p>
The bringing in of the fences was in itself
stirring.  White-wigged postilions of the old
style, rode in pairs of grey horses harnessed to
capacious wagons, and in a few minutes all was complete.
</p>

<p>
Decidedly the drama of the exhibition was the
jumping, while the riding of the foreign cavalry
officers, who had not before been seen in England,
was one of the sensations, for there are no finer
horsemen in the world, unless from among the
Cossacks and the cowboys, and their talents are
especially distinguished in taking the banks and
big, stiff fences at full speed.
</p>

<p>
Through the heavy wooden and iron doors
there trotted in one by one, French, Belgian,
American, and Spanish horsemen, who were to
teach the English how to high-jump, over forty
coming to the post, their brilliant uniforms
adding the last touch of colour to the scene.
</p>

<p>
The first horse touched the triple bar, but
otherwise did a perfect course, though at the five
feet bank which finishes the latter, he slid along
the platform prone, and on all fours, and, like
many of the English horses, could scarcely
recover his legs.
</p>

<p>
It was a remarkable sight to see the string
of horses take the gates, bars, bushes, and fences
in the glare of thousands of electric lights; the
row of wooden posts was an ugly jump always.
The terrible triple-bar, most risky of all the
Continental jumps, now introduced to English
horsemen for the first time, was constantly
crashing down, amid half-sustained shrieks from
the women in the audience, as the riders were
thrown, or jerked on the necks of their steeds,
and it was here that all the British officers came
to grief, though they took their fences with the
abandon and dash of a quick burst in the shires.
Indeed their riding was remarkably clever and
plucky, considering that they had never before
been through such a performance, and were all
riding green horses.  The latter broke into a
gallop as they approached the sloping bank, with
a deep and abrupt fall on the far side, swinging
sharply to the left, and took at tremendous speed
the circle of jumps, each distinct from the rest,
then finished down the middle, taking this time,
not the slope, but the wall of the bank, and so
disappeared through the gates into the stables.
</p>

<p>
All the other obstacles fell when the horse
collided with them, but, as one of the competitors
remarked, "There's no give in that bank," and
it was here that nearly all of the mishaps
occurred.  A Lifeguardsman went at the bank as
if he were charging an army, but the horse
sprang short, and his rider was shot high over
his head.  He turned a complete somersault, and
fell on his back on the top of the bank; the horse
followed, and appeared to jump on the prostrate
rider.  Ring attendants and judges ran towards
him, but the lieutenant picked himself up smartly&mdash;he
had not released his hold of the reins&mdash;and
mounting the hunter on the top of the bank,
rode it down the slope, and out of the arena, amid
enthusiastic plaudits for his pluck.
</p>

<p>
England was not alone in the matter of
mishaps.  One of the 2nd Chausseurs à Cheval,
of the Belgian Army, although a splendid
steeplechase rider, also fell at the bank.  He went
round the course at a smart gallop, and cleared
everything without registering a touch.  His
beautiful bay gelding went at the bank at full
speed, but appeared to make no attempt to rise
at it&mdash;the animal's chest struck the vertical side
of the embankment, his rider shot into the air,
and he too fell on his back.  The lieutenant
landed on top of the bank, and the horse remained
below.
</p>

<p>
A mettlesome bay mare from Belgium, ridden
by an officer who wore the gorgeous uniform
of the 2nd Belgian Lancers, refused the first
obstacle, and ran round it; refused the second,
and dashed among the judges, scattering them
right and left.  After five minutes' display of
temper all over the arena, she was ordered out,
and eventually, with some persuasion, went,
having jumped nothing but the judges' table.
</p>

<p>
Many of the horses had never jumped inside a
building before, and used to the open showyard,
were made nervous, almost frantic, by the colours,
the music, the people, and the general
strangeness of the surroundings, intensified by the glare
of the electric light, and the unfortunate illumination
of the trees.  So greatly were the nerves of
some of the best-known leapers affected, that
often the judges and messenger boys were sent
scurrying when a nervous horse refused his jump,
and careered at full speed round the ring.
</p>

<p>
So for an hour, in quick succession, followed
each other the best horses and horsemen of
Europe&mdash;some conspicuous for a close, immovable,
jockey-like seat, the English hunters for
dash, and the Belgians for coolness and neatness.
The difference in the way the men of foreign
nationalities sat their horses, keenly interested
Chris, for they did so, if not as gracefully, at least
more effectively than the average English rider
in a jumping competition.  Some of them began,
continued, and finished the course crisply, and at
high speed, with an unmoved seat, even when
heavy men.  He noted that the foreigner rides
with long stirrups, and more by balance than the
Englishman, though there was one exception,
his stirrups were as short as a jockey's, his
knees crooked high, and pressed very tight&mdash;so
steady and sympathetic a seat Chris had seldom
seen.
</p>

<p>
No one could help admiring the Belgian officer's
riding, how he never touches his horse's mouth,
but sits as if he were part of the horse, even if it
jumped a little slowly, or "stickily," as we should
say.  More than once, delightful instances of the
kindness of these officers to their horses were
given.  When a fence was refused, no rough
words were used, or resentment shown&mdash;a pat
of the neck, an encouraging whisper, and the
horse tried again, succeeded, and seemed even
happier in his success than his gentle master.
</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting figures in the
jumping competitions, the champion jump rider of
Belgium, appeared in a finely-fitting uniform, with
black coat, and blue riding breeches.  A lithe figure
with the moustachios of the Continental officer,
he had a perfect seat, and took the jumps, and
rode his horse at top speed at the high jump
instead of at a canter, as is usually thought
necessary for high jumping.  Chris was also keen
to observe how the horses threw up their heels
with a curious sharp jerk, or wriggle, when in the
act of topping an obstacle, the result of their
being trained to clear bars which are slightly
raised as they take their leap.
</p>

<p>
After all, thought Gay, it was very like
steeplechasing, with the sinister ambulance and
perfect medical arrangements in the
background ... that was why it interested Chris
to the exclusion of herself....  She watched his
face closely, as the reckless boy she had seen at
Elsinore, time after time appeared, and after more
than one crushing fall, limped from the arena, only
to reappear, indomitable as ever, and going at the
stiffest obstacles with an unconcern that Chris
himself could not have beaten.  Both rode for the
sheer zest and love of it, both counted accidents
as mere incidents that did not seriously interfere
with their pleasure; yes&mdash;they would have made
a pair of dare-devils to ride against each other,
and there was keen envy in Chris's eyes as he
watched the other.
</p>

<p>
The only round without a mistake was to the
credit of Belgium and Holland, and though a
famous Dorset yeoman rode the fastest, and one
of the most faultless courses on a superb horse,
undoubtedly the honours were with the foreigners.
They must have got quite a wrong impression of
our hunters ridden by officers, for whether it were
that the horses were unaccustomed to the scene,
or that the riders felt awkward, and communicated
their nervousness to their horses, they gave a very
different account of themselves to what they would
do any day in a cross-country run.
</p>

<p>
"Just fancy that out of us all, there is only
one Englishman who can compete with our
visitors!" exclaimed Gay ruefully to Rensslaer,
who had joined them towards the close of the
steeplechase competition.
</p>

<p>
"And what can you expect?" he said quietly.
"A young horse-owner in this country either
hunts or plays polo, or both, but he never
troubles himself with showing horses, except
occasionally at the semi-private shows of
Ranelagh and Hurlingham.  You see, the English no
longer regard horsemanship as a national
sport&mdash;the foreigners do; we are all wrong in that
respect."
</p>

<p>
"There's far more of the circus than of legitimate
sport about the sort of thing we have just
seen," said Tom Bulteel; "in short, it doesn't
appeal to the hunting man at all.  Who wants
the high jump, or the wide jump for horses?
English jumping is practically confined to the
hunting field, and the steeplechase course, and
all the best hunters, if well ridden, can be
taught to cross all reasonable country, while the
'chasers' are schooled to jump what is known
as the regulation course."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!" cried Effie, and Tom went on warmly.
</p>

<p>
"This high jumping is a trick&mdash;and the horses
who do it, mustn't on any account be hunted, or
they lose the knack of flinging themselves over
a high bar&mdash;and personally I prefer a clever
hunter.  In fact, the so-called champion hunter
class is a misnomer, and putting the qualified
hunter classes in the evening is a huge mistake.
Of course a hunter ought to be able to jump
these fences, as far as height or width are
concerned, but it's no part of a hunter's business to
jump over white fences under the glare of electric
light."
</p>

<p>
"All the same," said Rensslaer, "I confess
that I should like to see the Army devoting
itself to the art, as the Italian Army does, and
it would be to the good if private and public
schools provided ponies, and taught the young
idea how to ride, as well as how to shoot.  A
troop of boy rough-riders would be a lively
accompaniment to the corps of sharp-shooters
multiplying under Lord Roberts' organisation.
The Army here, in buying horses, demands from
the farmer horses already highly trained, which
is obviously impossible.  How different the
behaviour of the Italians and the Belgians!
The horses they ride are almost exclusively
Irish.  The dealers resident in Ireland are
continually shipping young Irish horses, which go
straight to the colonels of the several regiments,
who get them trained; the officers buy and train
their private horses in a similar way, and regard
the education of a horse as one of, if not quite,
the best of sports."
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," grunted Tom Bulteel, "if England
has something to learn from Continental rivals in
methods of training, we may find consolation in
the fact that it is from British equine flesh, bone,
and blood that competitors abroad have been able
to produce the splendid animals that are winning
the judges' encomiums to-day.  Their clean action
in harness, and over the sticks betrays their British
origin, whatever may be the nationality of their
owners."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Tom!" cried Effie, and slipped her
little hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"And so I repeat," said Torn sturdily, "that it
is not fair to judge us in a place ringing with
noisy demonstrations, that are dead against a
high-class hunter giving his best form.  The
foreign or American show hunter is used to such
conditions, and the consequence is, that many a
moderate horse gets forward simply on account of
his jumping abilities.  Far too much importance
is attached to what is after all trick jumping, and,
as I said before, it is by no means necessary in a
hunter."
</p>

<p>
And so with ups and downs, principally downs
with Gay&mdash;and her face as she sat ignored at
Chris's side told more than she knew&mdash;the time
passed, and the last and "championship" night of
the great show arrived.
</p>

<p>
It was a scene of extraordinary brilliancy, and
even more than the rest of the spectators, Chris
was wrought to the highest pitch of excitement
during the high-jumping contest at the close of
the evening, when gradually twenty-two horses
were fined down to two&mdash;the one ridden by the
Dorset yeoman, the other by Belgium's champion
jump rider, who had acquitted himself so grandly
throughout.
</p>

<p>
When Lord Lonsdale offered a prize to
whichever could clear 7 feet, and the Belgian's
horse came along like lightning, and with a
mighty spring into the air, cleared the obstacle
with an inch or two to spare, Chris felt the blood
course like warm milk through his veins&mdash;in fancy
he rose to the jump, and the ecstacy, the oneness
of horse and man in those moments, were his.
</p>

<p>
The Englishman put his horse at the bar,
failing at the first attempt, but succeeding at
the second, going over beautifully.  They both
cleared 6 feet 9 inches, but neither succeeded
at 7 feet, and were declared tied, the prize
being divided, and the two horses parading round
the ring amid a scene of the greatest enthusiasm.
Suddenly Chris turned&mdash;in that moment of
expansion, he wanted Gay to share it with him,
but she was not there.  She and the others had
slipped away without his noticing; no doubt
they had all gone down to the stables, and he
rose eagerly to follow them.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to congratulate Rensslaer on his
triumphs, to tell him that he accepted his offer of
St. Swithin's, and if he got no opportunity of
speaking to her to-night, next morning he would
call on dear little Gay and tell her that his love for
her had triumphed.  If she had only known it, Chris
was proving his right to the title of hero, for this
was his real farewell to the sport he so intensely
loved&mdash;if he had seemed to neglect Gay,
when she knew the reason, she would forgive
him....

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
TOO LATE!
</h3>

<p>
Rensslaer appeared immediately after breakfast
next morning in Connaught Square, and Gay,
warmly congratulating him on his victories,
heard that the result of the great show worked
out in cups, championships, and prizes in the
following order:
</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 10%">
  England, 16 cups & championships, 91 1st prizes.
  U. States 2  "           "        14      "
  France   --  "           "         1      "
  Belgium  --  "           "         1      "
  Holland   1  "           "        --      "
  Canada   --  "           "         2      "
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"And everyone thought the Belgian champions
were going to sweep the board!" cried Gay.
"After all, the foreigner by no means had it all
his own way, for of the three champion cups
awarded, two were secured by a Kentish man,
the third going to America."
</p>

<p>
"It was a good show," said Rensslaer, looking
very pleased, as well he might, but, though Gay
did not know it, more on her account than his
own; it was not to rejoice over his own triumphs,
but to share <i>her</i> happiness that he had called thus
early.  But as she gave no sign, he offered no
congratulations, and they chatted about the
Show for awhile, agreeing that the keenest
competitions, both from the international aspect,
and that of individual merit, were undoubtedly
the high jump, and the four-in-hands, and he told
her that they hoped to persuade the Italians to
come over to the next Horse Show, adding that
they were the finest riders in the world.
</p>

<p>
Gay nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Bulteel says that never before have
so many high-class animals been on show in this
or any other country.  You must be awfully
proud, Mr. Rensslaer.  You were certainly one
of the most popular of the exhibitors, and your
successes were cheered to the echo."
</p>

<p>
"I will venture to offer you the pick of my
horses for your wedding present," he said, and
Gay coloured brilliantly; how on earth could he
know already of her engagement?
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad," he said warmly, and got up
and went over to her, kissing her little hand
so beautifully that she felt sure he <i>had</i> often done
it before.
</p>

<p>
"He is the best fellow in the world," said
Rensslaer.  "I never saw two people more
exactly suited to each other.  His giving up
what is really a passion with him, is a proof not
only of his great love for you, but a moral victory,
revealing the real strength of his character."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he never really cared for it," said Gay
in some surprise, "and you see he had to give it
up, whether he liked it or not."
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer was silent, a little chilled and
disappointed.  Surely this was not the Gay that
he thought he knew....
</p>

<p>
"I think you will like the house," he said.
"It is very quaint and old&mdash;some distance from
Elsinore, but within the park&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Gay looked at him, astonished.
</p>

<p>
"Has he spoken to you already about a new
country place?" she said.  "Carlton has several,
you know, but no house in town.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Carlton?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Why, who else are we talking about?"
exclaimed Gay in astonishment, but she had
gone rather pale.
</p>

<p>
"Of Chris Hannen, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Why of course?"
</p>

<p>
Gay's brows were raised; some of the hot
anger that burned in her against Chris overnight,
burned still.
</p>

<p>
"Because you love him," said Rensslaer quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Love him?  Love a man who doesn't even
see me if a horse is around&mdash;who is deaf, dumb
as a stock-fish, blind to everything save an
animal that can jump?"
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously Gay had put up two distracted
hands to her face in the precise attitude of
Rensslaer's "Little Mermaid," but it was
indignation, not grief, that distorted her
features.
</p>

<p>
"What has the boy done?" inquired
Rensslaer in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Done?  All the passion that is <i>in</i> him goes
into horses&mdash;and where do <i>I</i> come in?  Better a
thousand times Carlton Mackrell's devotion!
Oh, he wasn't afraid to sacrifice himself for my
pleasure!  There's a grain of romance in him
somewhere, to do what he did&mdash;and Chris without
a qualm, sacrifices <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But does he?" said Rensslaer, getting up
from his chair, and walking, more perturbed than
Gay had ever seen him, about the room.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Does</i> he?" said Gay witheringly.  "Oh, it
was bad enough right through the Show&mdash;there
was thunder in the air all along&mdash;but things
came to a head last night with the high jump
competition."  She paused to smile ruefully as
the suitability of her comparison struck her.
"He forgot my very existence&mdash;didn't even <i>hear</i>
when I spoke to him!"
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer shook his head, tried to get in a
word edgeways, but failed; Gay was wound up,
and meant to go on.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can speak to you!" she cried
passionately.  "You will understand, as some
men can't, how last night in a sudden revulsion of
feeling, I turned from selfish Chris to devoted
Carlton, who was looking at me, thinking of me
only, as always&mdash;he had never presented his
little bill&mdash;well, I would honour it to the full, even
before it was presented.  If Chris had looked at
me then ... but he did not.  When I got up, and
we went out to the stables, it was all over really,
and outside one of those preposterous chiffon
stalls Carlton asked me, and I said&mdash;'Yes.'"
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," said Rensslaer consolingly,
"only you said 'Yes' to the wrong man.  Now,
if you had waited a little longer&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A little longer!  Hasn't this Horse Show
been going on for a week, and has Chris Hannen
had one thought, one word, when jumping was
on, for me?"
</p>

<p>
"He was charming to you whenever I saw
you," said Rensslaer.  "You seemed completely
happy together, and admirably well suited, as
always."
</p>

<p>
"So we are&mdash;were, I mean," said Gay.
</p>

<p>
"And I think St. Swithin's, with congenial
work among my horses, would have suited
Mr. Hannen very well," said Rensslaer quietly.
"No steeplechasing, of course&mdash;that was in the
bond&mdash;but plenty of legitimate riding."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," faltered Gay, but all the
same she was beginning to do so, to realise what
her mad fit of temper had cost her.
</p>

<p>
"He couldn't help being interested in the
jumping right through&mdash;he has never seen anything
like it before&mdash;and he rides magnificently
himself&mdash;I believe could have done anything the
others did.  Naturally he didn't want to miss a
single point of horsemanship, or any foreign
wrinkle&mdash;and can you blame him?  He was
watching others do what he knew he would
never have the chance to do&mdash;what he
longed intensely to do only he loved you more."
</p>

<p>
"More?" said Gay faintly, and into the young
face that he had first seen so careless and happy,
came a look of misery that pierced Rensslaer's
tender heart.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I offered him a thousand a year, and a
house at Elsinore, on condition he gave up
steeplechasing, and he came to me last night after the
Show, and said he accepted my offer, and was
coming this morning to tell you, and ask you to
marry him.  You had left, or I feel sure he
would have asked you then."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor Chris!" breathed the girl, her arms
falling to her sides, her grey eyes looking straight
before her.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;poor Mackrell," said Rensslaer quietly,
"for you will be doing him a great wrong if you
marry him, loving the other man as you do.  And
I don't wonder"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"for Chris Hannen
is the nicest boy I ever knew.  Tell Mackrell it's
all a mistake, and as a man of honour he must
at once release you."
</p>

<p>
"I never break my word," said Gay.  "A
pretty rotten sportswoman I should be if I did.
If Chris came straight to me on leaving Elsinore,
and talked of nothing but your shooting, without
saying a word of the splendid chance you had
given him, he deserves to suffer for such criminal
carelessness as regards his own welfare, and my
happiness&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He will," said Rensslaer drily&mdash;"so will you,
for I'm afraid the aimless sort of existence
Mackrell lives, won't appeal to you at all, unless
you live abroad, and he goes in seriously for
Trotting."
</p>

<p>
"As if I would leave Frank like that!" cried
Gay indignantly.  "Of course it will be a long
engagement&mdash;years and years!"
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer smiled.  In that case Chris, who was
no laggard in anything he undertook, might be
trusted to readjust the position, but that there
would be a stiff tussle over the girl there was no
manner of doubt.
</p>

<p>
She looked worth any man's love in the short
skirt, striped cambric shirt, and mannish tie that
she affected of mornings, her eyes full of battle,
and her heart of trouble.  Then she made a great
effort, and pulled herself together.
</p>

<p>
"I am very selfish," she said, "and have not
half congratulated you on all your successes.  It
was very very wonderful, of course, but I'd rather
have that afternoon at Elsinore over again&mdash;the
peace, the loveliness&mdash;I was thinking of it the
whole time at Olympia."
</p>

<p>
"It is waiting for you," said Rensslaer quietly,
"and as often as you like, when you come to live
at St. Swithin's Court&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Gay turned aside, to hide the tears that rushed
to her eyes at the thought of all she had thrown
away, and at that moment the door opened to
admit Lossie, who was deathly pale, waiting with
ill-disguised impatience for Rensslaer to make his
farewells, and depart.  Left together, the two
girls faced each other, but it was Lossie who
spoke first.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't true?"
</p>

<p>
"What is not true?"
</p>

<p>
"That Carlton asked you last night, that you
said 'Yes'&mdash;Oh!  I saw it in his eyes&mdash;in
yours&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is true."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!" cried Lossie, and beat her
hands together.  "You are doing a great wrong
to yourself and Chris&mdash;ruining your own life, and
breaking two men's hearts&mdash;you and Carlton are
utterly unsuited to each other&mdash;and all for a bit
of temper&mdash;because Chris paid more attention to
the horses at the Show, than he did to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's done," said Gay, voice and eyes
dull, "and it can't be undone."
</p>

<p>
"But it can!  Do you suppose Carlton will
take what has been flung to him in a moment
of pique&mdash;like a bone to a dog?  Doesn't he
deserve to be loved just as much&mdash;and more&mdash;than
Chris does?  Oh! he could love a million
times better&mdash;you have never troubled to sound
the depths of his heart&mdash;and you are committing
a cruel wrong&mdash;a crime even&mdash;if you go to him,
knowing that you love Chris!"
</p>

<p>
"Come to my den," said Gay sharply.
"Carlton may be here at any moment, and
must not find us quarrelling over him," and she
led the way, followed hastily by a woman who
had lost all regard for appearances, and who in
her godless selfishness recognised no rights but
those of her passions.
</p>

<p>
"It is not a matter for your decision or mine,"
said Gay, when the door was shut, "but for
Carlton.  If he holds me to my promise, I shall
keep it."
</p>

<p>
"But you'll tell him that you love Chris?"
cried Lossie eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Gay shook her head.  She was very angry
with Chris, and his playing the laggard that
morning, was the finishing stroke to his utter
inconsiderateness and folly.  She deeply resented
his having spoken to Rensslaer first, accepting
his offer, and thereby taking it for granted that
she was ready to fall into his arms&mdash;Gay forgot
that she had given him no chance of doing so, as
she had left the building before the performance
was over.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden womanly comprehension, born
of her own pain, she turned to her cousin, no
radiant apparition as of yesterday, but trembling,
haggard, dishevelled almost in her excitement
and agony, yet more beautiful than ever in that
abandonment.
</p>

<p>
"I wish he loved you, Lossie," cried Gay
breathlessly.  "I do wish it with all my heart,
and it is quite true what you say&mdash;that you are
much better suited to him than I am."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the chance," cried Lossie, clasping
her hands together in desperate entreaty.  "He
can't know how I love, how I <i>adore</i> him; if he
did, and that just as I love him, you love Chris,
he couldn't help loving <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't love Chris like that," protested
Gay, shrinking a little from this woman whose
eyes, lips, voice were passion incarnate;
instinctively she knew that a man prefers to find
most of the vehemence himself....
</p>

<p>
A servant knocked at the door, and announced
that Mr. Mackrell was in the drawing-room, and
the impulse, swift as a bird's homing flight, that
took Lossie half-way across the room to go to
him, startled Gay&mdash;just so would she have sped
to Chris had all been well between them&mdash;and
had not love his rights; was not Rensslaer only
but now insisting on them?
</p>

<p>
"Lossie," she said, "if you can convince
Carlton that your love will make him happier
than my"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"affection can, go to
him now."
</p>

<p>
But Lossie, turning even whiter, trembled, and
shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I daren't," she said in a whisper, "it must
come from you.  He would never forgive me&mdash;only
if you were Chris's wife, I might have a
chance....  Oh, Gay, I've been a beast to you
often, but you've had all the luck, and I've had
none"&mdash;she was like a passionate child clamouring
for the toy that she coveted, thought her
cousin, it was a bright, expensive toy that Gay did
not want herself, she only wanted her dear old
rag doll, for so she at that moment absurdly
designated Chris.
</p>

<p>
"Carlton must decide," she said, and went
with lagging steps to the drawing-room, where
her lover very quickly <i>did</i>, for he stepped
up close, held her fast, and kissed her&mdash;kissed
her like a man who had long starved for that
moment, and could not take enough.
</p>

<p>
As she tore herself away, she could have
wept to think that the first kiss of her lips
was not for Chris, and the contrast of Carlton,
supremely handsome and happy, with the girl she
had just left, revolted her.  Her voice was
strange as she said,
</p>

<p>
"Will you go to my den?  I will follow you
there immediately," and turned aside that he
might not see her face.
</p>

<p>
He coloured with disappointment and surprise,
but of course there would be greater privacy
there...  Without a word he went.
</p>

<p>
As the door closed him in with Lossie, Chris
came flying up the stairs, taking three steps at a
time, a young god in his swiftness, strength and
joy, bringing all the best gifts that life and love
can bring to the beloved woman&mdash;too late.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br><br>
A DEBT OF HONOUR
</h3>

<p>
It was not until Chris had caught Gay in those
long, muscular arms of his, and lifted her clean
off her feet, only to find her fiercely fighting his
kisses, that he realised how completely his feelings
had run away with him, how he had taken everything
for granted, and he begged her forgiveness
as he set her gently on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Had a bother in the stable&mdash;one of my horses
gone clean off his head," he said in his boyish
way, "or I should have been here with the
morning milk.  I've got grand news, darling,
Rensslaer has given me a berth and house at
Elsinore&mdash;I'm giving up steeplechasing, and
we're going to be happy ever after!"
</p>

<p>
"Are we?" she said; it did not sound like
Gay's voice at all, and she was rubbing her lips
with a tiny pocket-handkerchief as if she were
trying to rub something out.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" said Chris, suddenly
sobered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing," cried Gay, reckless in her pain,
"only that so far as I am concerned, you are
welcome to go on steeplechasing for ever&mdash;it's
no concern of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Dear little girl," said Chris remorsefully, "I
did neglect you shamefully last night, but that
wonderful jumping&mdash;you see those jumps represented
all the most ingenious obstacles invented
by Continental riders, and naturally it's intensely
interesting to a man who 'chases&mdash;even if he
doesn't do it like them, over trick fences.  And
then the riding," he burst out reminiscently, "such
riding as you don't get in a century of good riders,
at any rate, all assembled at the same time and
place."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, spare me!" cried Gay, so angrily that his
face fell, and she felt a brute as she saw how she
had wiped all the brightness out of it.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," he said pluckily, "we shall get
plenty of hunting, Rensslaer says, and a stiff
run is almost as good as a steeplechase.  He
has a horse that will carry you beautifully."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be there," cried Gay, and stamped
her foot.  "How dare you take it for granted
that I shall go where I have not even been
asked?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Chris wrathfully, "didn't I ask
you at the Ffolliott's dance&mdash;didn't I ask you
again in this very room after my accident?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you didn't," said Gay.  "It was <i>I</i> who
said I'd give up Trotting, if you would racing,
and you wouldn't!"
</p>

<p>
"But it was a perfectly understood thing," said
Chris, "that if I dropped steeplechasing, you
would marry me, and I have&mdash;and what more
do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Gay point-plank.  "While
you've been shilly-shallying, I've been making
other plans&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"You have certainly been a little wretch to
me," said Chris gravely, "and really, Gay, you
must try to control your temper better, if we are
going to hit it when we're married."
</p>

<p>
Gay gasped and sat down; so did Chris, though
he kissed her first before she knew it&mdash;how
fearfully quick he was in everything&mdash;but
Carlton could be quick too....  She put her
handkerchief away; she did not want to rub out
that last kiss....
</p>

<p>
"My dear little girl," said Chris, and his
young face, very near hers, was so handsome,
and true, and tender, that she looked away
from it, while a dreadful ache came into her
heart, "I am doing for you what I would not for
my mother, God bless her, and all we've got to
think about now, is to be happy&mdash;"  He alone knew
at what immense cost to himself he had gained
at last the victory, took it for granted that Gay
would appreciate, and reward it accordingly.
</p>

<p>
"It's too late," she said miserably.  "I am
bound twice over to Carlton&mdash;once by a debt of
honour&mdash;once by my word&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You are nothing of the sort," said Chris, who
was far from realising the situation.  "Mackrell
played up well certainly about the Vase, but his
motives were interested, and he'd be a rotter if
he regarded you as being in his debt.  I don't
wish the poor chap any harm, but I'm afraid
he'll have to put up with Lossie, unless she
changes her mind."
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;he is with Lossie just now," said
Gay nervously, "but he may be here at any
moment&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not if he accepts her," said Chris, chuckling,
"for I imagine there's something in the wind."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to run down and see the
Professor?" she cried eagerly.  "He's always so
delighted to see you!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite happy where I am," said Chris,
smiling broadly.  What a shy little thing she
was, and what ridiculous ideas she got into her
head; it was a relief to find she could be silly
after all!  "You are looking very pretty this
morning," and he looked her over admiringly.
Gay blushed&mdash;somehow she never <i>did</i> look nice
without wishing for Chris to be there, and see
how nice she looked.
</p>

<p>
"I hear St. Swithin's Court is charming," he
said&mdash;"the place where we're going to live, you
know&mdash;and the work Rensslaer's giving me will
suit me down to the ground.  Just fancy <i>living</i> in
the midst of that paradise of horses!  And he's
giving me a thousand a year&mdash;rippin', ain't it?"
and he kissed Gay again before she could stop
him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, can't we be married early next month,
go abroad for a bit, and be home in good time for
the shooting?  Morning, Mackrell!" as that
gentleman came in, and Gay half rose, her heart
beating wildly....  With a sick sense of despair,
after one glance at his face, she knew that Lossie
had failed.
</p>

<p>
"We were just talking about St. Swithin's, the
little place that goes with the berth Rensslaer has
given me," said Chris.  "If the birds are all
right, we'll be very pleased if you'll make one of
the guns on the First&mdash;won't we, Gay?"
</p>

<p>
There was a queer silence for a moment, then
Carlton said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there's some mistake.  Gay is
engaged to me for the First&mdash;and for many other
Firsts, I hope."
</p>

<p>
Chris's glance flashed from one to the other,
even in that moment he lived up to his motto,
"Never show when you're hit," but his jaws
gritted together, as, with an upward jerk of his
bright head, he said:
</p>

<p>
"A very serious mistake, as Miss Lawless is
engaged to me."
</p>

<p>
Both men were standing, and at what Gay saw
on their faces, she rose also, and stood between
them.
</p>

<p>
"I am engaged to Carlton Mackrell," she said
to Chris.  "Will you please go away now?"
</p>

<p>
After one long look between her eyes, without
a word Chris went, his proud young face impassive
as Rensslaer's Indian; yet Gay felt as if there
had been murder done, when the door closed, and
involuntarily she stretched out her arms towards it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!" she whispered.  "Come back,
for I love you, Chris ... I <i>love</i> you."
</p>

<p>
Carlton heard&mdash;but this scene was a mere
anti-climax to the one he had just gone through, and
as he had held to his purpose in that one, so was
he resolute to hold to it in this, where so much
more was at stake....
</p>

<p>
Even if she loved Chris Hannen, what then?
Gay must be protected against herself&mdash;made
happy in spite of herself&mdash;a man always thinks
he can make a woman that, in spite of all
observation and experience to the contrary....
All these weeks of his absence, Chris had had
his chance, and lost it.  That the boy liked Gay
well enough, Carlton knew, but <i>not so much as
horses</i>.  His behaviour throughout the Horse
Show had proved that&mdash;and even if Rensslaer
had given him a berth in his stables, where did
Gay come in?  The more superb the horses,
the greater Chris's facilities for breaking his
neck; anyway, there would be no comfort or
peace of mind for the girl, and it was pure
selfishness on Chris's part to want her to sacrifice
herself to him.
</p>

<p>
In the few moments that Gay's fate trembled
in the balance, she stole a glance at him, and saw
his face pale, ravaged by the ordeal through
which he had just passed, by this even fiercer
one with scarce a breath between.
</p>

<p>
"You promised me, Gay," he said quietly, and
she bowed her head, slipped to the door, and left
him to the full bitterness of his triumph.
</p>

<p>
But when she had locked herself into her den,
she glanced round the room as if the drama, lately
enacted there, still palpitated, living in the air....
To a manly man there can be no hour more
painful, than when his rights are invaded, and the
impossibility demanded of him of a love where
no love is; but it was of Lossie's passion and
humiliation that Gay was thinking, of the
uselessness of it, not Carlton's pain ... and then
Chris's haggard, white, proud young face as it
had looked just now, came&mdash;and stayed.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
<br><br>
DEAD SEA APPLES
</h3>

<p>
It was late October, and Chris was riding harder
than ever, and on the principle, as he told himself
grimly, of "lucky in horses, unlucky in love,"
was having success after success, not only as a
jockey, but a trainer, and bid fair to have a good
stable of his own before long.
</p>

<p>
Gay had gone abroad with indecent suddenness
immediately after her engagement, dragging the
Professor with her, and forbidding Carlton to
accompany them, because "she wanted a little
time with Frank, since she was so soon to leave
him."  Yet, when at last she came back, after
three months' absence, and then only because her
brother insisted on it, Carlton was never able
to get a moment alone with her, try as he might.
</p>

<p>
The devices she had used to stave off his
proposal she used with fourfold skill to avoid being
alone with him, she who had detested society,
surrounded herself at all hours with it; even when
she had to choose the decorations for the house
he had taken in Norfolk Street, she took Effie
Bulteel with her; the jewels he gave her, she
never wore.
</p>

<p>
She treated her new tie as a purely nominal one,
appeared careless and fancy-free; but she meant
to go through with her bargain all the same, and
a date in December had been actually fixed for
the wedding, when the Professor with his usual
inconvenience, fell ill.
</p>

<p>
Gay always declared that the trouble began
with his discovery of a wonderful new microbe,
that after due blazonment in the medical press,
turned out to be something quite different to
what it pretended to be, and, as she expressed it,
sat up on its squirmy tail, making insulting faces
at its non-discoverer.  Frank took the matter so
much to heart as to be at first hesitatingly ailing,
then with considerably less hesitation, and as it
entailed no effort, really ill for some time.
</p>

<p>
Nature was exacting her toll for his unhealthy,
sedentary life, with its late hours, and lack of
exercise, and all the tenderness for which Gay in
those days had no other outlet, expended itself
on him.  She was a most devoted nurse, but to
Carlton it almost looked as if, like the little
boys and old Sam Weller's coach, the Professor
had done it "a-purpose," when he lingered
so unconscionably long a time over his
convalescence, and the beautiful house in Norfolk
Street still lacked a mistress.
</p>

<p>
It would be a cold, practical mistress, who
never gave its master a kiss, or word of love, or
welcome, and who as wife might reasonably be
expected to be still more the "woman with
no nonsense about her," that Gay evidently
nowadays aspired to be.
</p>

<p>
Some men like brilliant women, hard and
bright, others prefer hearts warm and tender.
Carlton was one of these last, for, as Lossie had
divined, there was a great capacity for romantic
love in the man.  Sometimes when most starved
for sympathy, for appreciation where he had the
right to expect it, he remembered the hot flood
of devotion, of passion, that Lossie had poured
out on him, and shivered in the isolation to
which Gay from the first had banished, and
rigorously kept him.
</p>

<p>
The heart makes its own decisions&mdash;Gay's had
made hers in that passionate cry, "Come back,
for I love you, Chris," and Carlton had thought
that he knew better than her heart what was
good for her, and reaped his reward in an
automaton that talked, and smiled, and conducted
itself with perfect grace and decorum, but that
was not Gay.
</p>

<p>
It was the other Gay he wanted&mdash;the girl
so full of life, and charm, and sparkle&mdash;the girl
who could give brave kisses, and love with the
thoroughness she put into everything that she
did, the delicious comrade, the trusty counsellor,
the dear household fairy who had the knack of
creating a home wherever she might be, and that
he had not hitherto found.
</p>

<p>
Well, he would not find it now&mdash;"for without
hearts, there is no home"&mdash;and his town and
country houses would be well ordered by a
capable house-mistress, cold and uninterested,
when the Professor, who seemed to be in no
hurry, set her free to assume her duties as wife.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, Lossie seemed the happiest of
the three, and having made her supreme appeal
to Carlton, had apparently forgotten all about it.
She met him without embarrassment, was friendly
without effort&mdash;sometimes he rubbed his eyes,
and thought he must have dreamed that vivid
scene with her in Gay's den; yet he found
himself thinking of it more often as time went on,
and sometimes searched her intensely blue eyes
for even a trace of the memory of it.  But he
found none&mdash;if Lossie, indeed, were playing a
game, she played it magnificently well.
</p>

<p>
She neither sought nor avoided him, was quite
pleasant, but profoundly indifferent, when they
met at Connaught Square or elsewhere, and,
most damning proof of all that she had ceased to
value his opinion, permitted herself slight lapses
in manner, and carelessnesses in dress before
him.  She even yawned occasionally in his face,
treating him, as he said angrily to himself, like
some damned old woman rather than the man
whom she most wished to please&mdash;but did she?
</p>

<p>
He came to the conclusion that her outbreak
had been a fit of nerves, combined with an
interested desire to share his very handsome
fortune, and that having failed, she thought no
more about him, but decided to turn her attention
elsewhere, the opportunity for doing so occurring
very shortly after his own engagement.
</p>

<p>
For the unexpected had happened.  Mrs. Elkins
was being dressed by her maid to go to
her lawyers, there to sign a fresh will she had
made, by which she left everything to her
favourite of the moment, and away from George
Conant, who had annoyed her, when in the
mirror, the woman saw the old lady's face contorted,
terrible, with the most ghastly look of fear
in her eyes, and though she struggled and fought
dumbly for hours, she never spoke again.
</p>

<p>
George flew to Lossie the moment he was
certain of what he had to offer her, and she
accepted him on the spot, to his intense joy,
while Gay so warmly encouraged the pair at her
house, that Carlton one day complained bitterly
of the ubiquity of that "grinning idiot," George
Conant, who certainly since his accession to
fortune, was more than ever like a Cheshire cat.
</p>

<p>
"He is an excellent match," said Gay coldly,
"and what is better, he adores Lossie&mdash;I don't
see why they should not be very happy.  She
will be the prettiest woman in his regiment, and
have no end of a good time."
</p>

<p>
Could this be Gay speaking&mdash;Gay who at one
time had been all heart and no head, who was
now all head and no heart?
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought," he said, "that love
might have some voice in the matter.  No woman,
surely, could love George Conant&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Gay bitterly, "when a girl can't
marry the man she loves, she may just as well
marry the man who loves her"&mdash;and Carlton
winced.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he had taken a mean advantage
of Gay, and was deeply humiliated, not only in
his honour, but his pride, for by way of being a
vain man, the simultaneous and utter indifference
of both girls, hit him hard.  Lossie had only
wanted him for his fortune, going to extremest
lengths to obtain it&mdash;Gay had wanted neither
him nor his money, and accepted him only in a
fit of passionate anger against Chris, of which
she had instantly repented.  Yet there was a
tenacity of purpose, as of love, about the man,
that forbade his throwing up the game.
</p>

<p>
As at every turn Lossie and Captain Conant
seemed to cross his path, the one all beauty and
(affected) happiness, the other all grin and
possessiveness, a sombre rage, with more of
heartache in it than he imagined, seized him.  For
many a man only misses a slighted love when,
barred from his own hearth-fires, he turns in his
extremity to it, only to find cold ashes, and
Carlton in those days felt very chilly and lonely
indeed.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lavinia had been anything but well
lately.  One day, speaking to Gay of the
Professor, who, like most doctors, was very
nervous about himself, she said:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my dear, when we are young, we only
<i>fear</i> we have complaints, when we are old, we
hope so."
</p>

<p>
Gay looked at her, startled.
</p>

<p>
"Do you find life such a grind, auntie?" she
said, rather falteringly, knowing whose fault it was
that "Laddie" was riding more recklessly than
ever, and how Lavinia suffered over it, for he was
the dearest thing in the whole world to her,
as perhaps <i>now</i> she was the dearest thing to him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear," said Lavinia quaintly, "life
goes on with ups and downs, with long oases of
worry, stagnation, and brief thrills of pleasure,
until one day, we suddenly awaken to find people
packing up in all directions&mdash;some have gone
without our noting it, or saying farewell, others
are in too great a hurry to think of us.  Then in
a panic, we decide to call together our friends of
long ago, to come and make merry with us, and
half the invitations come back to us, with 'gone
away' scrawled across them.  Then we rub our
eyes, and realise that our going away time is near
also, and henceforth we don't trouble much about
the affairs of life, only how to get ourselves off
decently, and in order."
</p>

<p>
Gay stooped and kissed the sweet little face,
but was far from understanding <i>then</i>.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer had been away during the autumn,
hunting at Spa, then he had been shooting
grizzlies in one place, and lions in another, but
with late November, he was back again, and the
first thing he did was to persuade Gay and the
fairly convalescent Professor, to come and stay
with him at Elsinore, where Frank spent his
whole time in the library, save when dragged
out for a drive.
</p>

<p>
Gay was abroad all day, either hunting with
Rensslaer, or about those stables of whose
inmates she never wearied, and once she found
her way alone to St. Swithin's Court, going
soft-footed over the house that was to have
been hers&mdash;hers and Chris's....
</p>

<p>
It was very quaint, and old, and beautiful,
and she peopled it with happy folk, and happy
voices, not all grown up.  Standing in the empty
rooms, with doors hanging melancholy on their
hinges, she saw it a nest of warmth, and love,
and laughter, heard the cheery voice, the
ringing tread that made the sweetest music in
all the world to her&mdash;felt with a passion of
longing, Chris's arm round her shoulder, and
his hard, lean young face pressed close to
hers....
</p>

<p>
She came to herself with a start, and there
rushed over her the memory of a big house in
town, all swept and garnished, waiting for her
to walk in, and take possession....  She covered
her eyes with her hands as if to shut out the
face of the man who would share it with her....
strange that what held all Heaven to Lossie,
should be so hateful to herself ... for both would
have regarded the world well lost for the man
they loved, yet the world, not that particular
man, was to be their portion.
</p>

<p>
The girls were better friends now than they
had ever been, greatly to the delight of Lavinia
(who held a brief for unsatisfactory people), for
generous Gay had come to understand Lossie
better now, discovered how much worse her
bark was than her bite.
</p>

<p>
Selfish she undoubtedly was, and in some
things unprincipled, but, like many other idle,
clever women, who have no hobby to occupy
their time, no great love, no real work to
sweeten their lives, she had turned her unused
energies into mischief, talked scandal, done
spiteful things, mainly for want of something
better to do.
</p>

<p>
Certainly she had many things to embitter
her that Gay had not, for by her own
recent experiences, Gay knew that suffering
of a certain kind does not ennoble, on the
contrary, it tends to deteriorate the character,
and ruin the temper.  With the ease of mind that
wealth brings, Lossie might develop into a very
different woman&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;now and
again would come to Gay flashes of insight, in
which she seemed to see poor blundering George
Conant, a mere hopeless pawn in the game
that Lossie was playing with such consummate
audacity and skill.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
<br><br>
THE GODS DECIDE
</h3>

<p>
Rensslaer never spoke of Chris, but one night,
when Carlton had gone back to town after
spending the day at Elsinore, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mackrell seems to dislike Captain
Conant very much."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then he had better cut out Captain Conant,
and marry Miss Lossie himself," said Rensslaer
quietly.
</p>

<p>
Gay laughed.
</p>

<p>
These two always understand one another,
almost as well, Gay thought, only differently,
as she and Chris did.  And Gay knew his story
now, shyly suggested rather than told, a story of
self-denial, of self-abnegation for the sake of
one loved only too truly and well.
</p>

<p>
"They are admirably well suited to each
other," said Rensslaer.  "She adores <i>him</i>, and
your coldness, and his male dislike of
Captain Conant, are impelling him naturally
towards her&mdash;a little push, and the thing is
done."
</p>

<p>
Then they both laughed again, and Gay's
spirits rose enormously.
</p>

<p>
"I will ask them down without Captain
Conant," said Rensslaer, and he did, and
somehow he and Gay managed to lose them
in the park, and as it was some miles in length,
and Carlton especially absent-minded that
afternoon, this was not difficult.
</p>

<p>
"Gay looks ill," Carlton said abruptly, revealing
the direction his thoughts had taken, when they
turned to find their companions vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Lossie, and shrugged
her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Why of course?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke sharply, with an intense feeling
of humiliation.  Lossie, turning to look at him,
thought a little cruelly of <i>her</i> bitter hour; it was
his turn now.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see that she is utterly wretched,"
she said, "and thinks it her fault that Chris
Hannen is trying to kill himself harder than
ever?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the behaviour of a moral coward," said
Carlton sternly; "but he was never half good
enough for her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Lossie, "it isn't what is good
enough for us, but what we <i>want</i>, that matters!"
</p>

<p>
He turned to look at her&mdash;eyes, lips, hair,
every bit of her, warm with&mdash;what?  And he was
cold, so cold, bleeding in his pride and self-esteem,
it was Gay he wanted, but she had gone far
to freeze out all the love that was in him....
</p>

<p>
"And is it George Conant you want so
badly?" he said quietly, but with a sensation of
stealing warmth in his veins to which they were
of late unaccustomed.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to marry him," she said
contemptuously, "and there will be five miserable
people more in the world, including Chris!"
</p>

<p>
"Why should you be miserable?" he said, but
his voice was not very steady, and his eyes were
trying to force hers to meet them.  "I'm sure
Conant will not be."
</p>

<p>
"It is not <i>his</i> happiness or mine, that counts
with you, but only Gay's," said Lossie, quietly.
</p>

<p>
He did not deny it, and a pang ran through
the girl.  He would never love anyone but Gay;
still, did that matter?  Lossie had enough love
for both&mdash;through suffering she had come to
know that the fulness of joy is in loving, not
in being loved.
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily both had stopped, and in the
wintry afternoon, with skeleton trees all about
them, they were looking in each other's faces&mdash;in
that moment Carlton saw his way clear, saw the
road that led to Gay's happiness, if not his
own&mdash;and took it.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
Lossie had never looked so lovely in her life,
or Carlton so manly, if frightfully pale, than
when, after an hour's absence, they came in, and
Gay got Lossie up into her bedroom, shut the
door, and turned round to remark:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Poor</i> Conant!"
</p>

<p>
That she did not say "Poor Carlton!" was
part of the tragedy of the whole thing&mdash;for
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gay," cried Lossie, "I didn't ask him
this time"&mdash;she blushed warmly&mdash;"but I've been
doing pretty much the same thing in a different
way."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Conant!" said Gay again.  "As Chris
would say, he'll be all top-boots and no grin!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is young&mdash;he will get over it," said
Lossie.  "I never pretended to care for him, and
as to suffering, haven't <i>I</i> gone through enough?"
</p>

<p>
"And pray," said Gay, who felt a great desire
to turn head over heels a great many times in
rapid succession, just as she had done when she
was a child, "when is Carlton going to tell me
that he has&mdash;has"&mdash;she pretended to weep&mdash;"jilted
me?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Lossie turned away; already
she was a better woman as she said:
</p>

<p>
"Gay, he knew that you loved Chris too much
for there to be the smallest scrap of love in your
heart left over for <i>him</i>.  He said that life
without love was like the sky without sun&mdash;that he
had been a selfish brute to think he could make
you happier than Chris could."
</p>

<p>
"He's quite right," said Gay, who had recovered
all her good looks in a moment, and with them
the old charm and <i>gaieté de cœur</i> that had so
distinguished her, "and if you'll get Mr. Rensslaer
to show you his sculpture and medals presently,
and leave Carlton and me together, I'll just tell
him that he's a dear&mdash;and that I love him."
</p>

<p>
Gay never told Chris, nor Carlton Lossie, what
was said during that brief interview in the Elsinore
drawing-room; but Gay, to her shame, realised
then, how consistently Carlton had played the game
of love, how if he had been greedy once, he had
sacrificed himself twice over for her, and tears
fell from her eyes that night, before she dropped
into the first dreamless slumber she had known
for months.
</p>

<p>
The Professor was delighted that her home
with him was to remain her home still, and
everyone was happy except George Conant and
Chris.  The latter knew nothing of the change
of partners, and went slogging away at his
failures and successes, seemingly quite unable
to break his neck, though he took every
opportunity of trying to do so.  Even when he <i>did</i>
hear the news, he made no comment, lowered his
proud shield of reserve to no man or woman
either.  It was no affair of his, when Gay had
"chucked" him; she had done it for once and
all, and he did not go near her.
</p>

<p>
There was not an ounce of vice in Chris, but
she had sent him further on the road to the devil
than anyone but himself, and perhaps
Mrs. Summers knew, and the devoted old woman
waxed more bitter against Gay day by day.  It
did not require the removal of certain photographs
from his rooms, to indicate who was responsible
for the change in him.
</p>

<p>
"As if, knowing how he misses his mother, she
oughtn't to stand by him through everything,"
said Mrs. Summers indignantly to herself, and
tried hard to make it up to her dear Mr. Chris
in extra attention.  But it did not seem to do
him much good; he was beginning to think that
there was a curse upon him, and that is a fatal
thing for a man, making him sometimes reckless,
sometimes bad, but seldom mentally, morally, or
physically better.
</p>

<p>
But he turned up at Mackrell's wedding in
December, and if each man surprised in the other's
eyes, a look that told how to both there might
be many women, but only one Gay, and Chris
suspected a supreme renunciation in Carlton's
taking Lossie as the only way to Gay's happiness,
he had no idea of screwing himself up a second
time to the sacrifice of all he held most dear.
</p>

<p>
Gay made a delightful bridesmaid, and Chris
was the smartest, most sought after man there.
He had always the air, the gay address, the
charm of one of Charles Lever's adventurous
heroes, belonged more to past times than present
ones, and Gay, defiantly flirting on her own
account, was appalled to see how easily and
naturally he could flirt also&mdash;with one very
lovely young married woman in particular, who
had long tried to annex him.  If he took a savage
delight in paying Gay back in her own coin,
inflicting a little of the pain on her that she had
inflicted on him, was it not very natural&mdash;though
not natural to Chris?
</p>

<p>
The most lovable nature is the easiest ruined,
the most unmalleable, when it has once turned
against what it loves.  Whether it were that
having made his one grand renunciation in vain,
Chris felt himself incapable of rising again to
such heights of self-sacrifice, or that the capacity
to love, as he had once loved, was forever scourged
out of him by Gay's failure to him at a supreme
moment, the fact remained that he could not, and
never meant to forgive her.  She had belonged
to Carlton first; it was Carlton who had had the
first kiss from her soft young lips, and many
others.  Chris could not know that all the kissing
had been on one side only, and very little of
that&mdash;the tactics Gay had practised when she desired
to ward off Carlton's proposals, were equally
successful in preventing his enjoying the privileges
of an accepted suitor.
</p>

<p>
The world, looking on at the meeting between
Chris and Gay, said that between two stools she
had fallen to the ground, that she had been a fool
to be cut out by her cousin, and what was worse,
it pitied her....
</p>

<p>
She had made a complete failure of Trotting,
(her horses were sold, and the sport was quite
given up), of matrimony, of everything, said that
same world, but Min Toplady rejoiced to see the
light come back to her darling's eyes, the spring
to her step, and the merry ring to her laugh, to
know her prettier, happier than she had been for
months past, her perpetual anxiety about Chris's
precious neck notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer too was satisfied.  St. Swithin's
still waited, the post he had offered Chris was
open still&mdash;so was Gay's heart, and all would
come right in time....
</p>

<p>
But months ran by, and it did not.
</p>

<p>
The Professor was still made exquisitely
comfortable by his sister, and pursued the selfish
tenor of his way.  Lossie reigned, <i>quite</i> good,
and <i>quite</i> happy, the triumphantly lovely mistress
of the house in Norfolk Street, and divers other
places, and Carlton, if not happy, was at least
resigned, and very proud of her.
</p>

<p>
Rensslaer pursued his various hobbies with
his usual quiet persistence, George Conant had
started a racing stable, and was squandering the
Elkins' thousands at a great rate, but all that Gay
ever heard of Chris now, was gleaned from the
papers.  He had been devoted to Lavinia, as
usual, when they met at the wedding, but had not
since been near her, and she thought his keeping
away a good sign, and a proof that he was
ashamed of his own stiff-neckedness.  But Gay
knew that by her failure in courage at a critical
moment of her life she had lost him, and that he
would give her no second chance.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what was honour, what was duty, compared
with love, when love had called her with Chris's
voice as it had done that morning?  There must
be some coward blot in her, some bad strain of
blood that prevented her being true to herself ... in
pluck, in love, in loyalty alike, she had failed
... she had only to say to Carlton, "It is all a
mistake; I accepted you in a fit of pique&mdash;under
a misunderstanding," but she had humiliated
Chris alike as a man and a lover in the presence
of his rival, and a man of the most sensitive
pride, he could not forgive her.
</p>

<p>
He had not turned his back on her when she
committed her mad escapade, got herself talked
about; angry as he was with her, he had not
shown it, only remonstrated quietly with her, and
in vain.  He had put up with all her tempers
without a murmur; his lovely disposition had
never once been at fault, or broken down under
the strain.  Finally, he had been prepared to give
up for her sake the profession he so deeply loved,
and she had thrown his renunciation back in his
face; if he met with a fatal accident, she alone
would be responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
She held her head as high as ever, and only
Carlton and Lavinia guessed what she suffered,
but with the end of the steeplechase season,
relief came, and she drew a free breath.  For
six months at least, Chris would be safe, and as
in the nature of things, he was bound to be
oftener in town, it was inevitable that sooner or
later they must meet.
</p>

<p>
And at last they did.  One day they passed
each other close in Piccadilly, Gay driving
herself, and Chris in a hansom with the Mrs. Guest
who had been at Lossie's wedding.  They produced
a flashing impression of youth, gaiety, and
good looks, and so completely wrapped up in
each other were they, that they did not even
see Gay, who drove on with the furies in her
heart.
</p>

<p>
So <i>that</i> was the reason that he could not
forgive her, because another woman had taken
her place in his heart...  Jealousy, overpowering,
terrible, racked poor Gay from then onwards&mdash;never
had she loved Chris so much, never was
it more impossible by look or word to try to call
him back to her.
</p>

<p>
It was equally certain that Chris was resolute
not to put himself within reach of such calling.
In proportion to a man's love for a woman, is
her power to influence him for good or evil, and
Chris owed her a secret grudge for inflicting on
him an injury that had done him no more good,
morally, than Carlton's rejection of Lossie's love
had once done her.  The Mrs. Guest episode
brought him little pleasure, and was not precisely
of his own seeking&mdash;considerably to his surprise,
too, his present existence did not satisfy him as
it had done, and at odd times he thought of that
other life which he could so pleasantly have lived
at St. Swithin's.
</p>

<p>
He felt a brute to keep away from Lavinia,
but in the frame of mind he then was, knew
himself to be no fit company for her.  Yet in the
event, just as her life had been one long occasion
of making opportunities for others, so by her
death were the two hopelessly alienated people
she loved best in the world, to be at last brought
together.
</p>

<p>
In June came the cruel, mercifully brief illness
that had threatened her so long, and Gay was
constantly at hand to help her bear it, but it was
to Chris she clung, who on his part plainly
dreaded to be parted from her, realising too late,
how lonely he would be, when the one woman
who had so good an influence over him was
gone.  Had he been her own, the son that Lavinia
had coveted, he could not have been more to her
than he was, displaying qualities that made Gay
admire and love him more with every hour.
Watchful and devoted, the full tenderness and
manliness of his nature were revealed with a
fulness that only made the more marked his
attitude towards Gay, to whom he remained cold,
courteous, and completely indifferent always.
</p>

<p>
Once it half broke her heart to hear him, when
he thought her absent, give Lavinia a message
for his mother.  Gay loved the simplicity of
belief that never doubted the old friends would
meet, suspected Chris's longing&mdash;who knows?&mdash;to
be going himself to the one he so loved, and had
never ceased to want.
</p>

<p>
"It will please her better that I can tell her you
are very happy, Laddie," said Lavinia, who by a
light invisible, saw what he did not.  "And, you
know, after all there is only one thing that matters,
one first, last word&mdash;Love"&mdash;but he did not seem
to hear her; there was a hard little kernel of
bitterness in his heart against Gay, that nothing
seemed able to remove.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
Chris was standing in the sunny blue dining-room,
staring straight before him, seeing nothing,
when a slight sound at hand made him wheel
suddenly, it was only a tired girl, weeping with
bowed head on her hands ... how many nights
and days had she been watching, and now needed
to watch no more....
</p>

<p>
Something in his heart gave way, and with it
all his fierce pride and unforgivingness towards
her, as he uttered her name, she looked up...
</p>

<p>
Haggard they were, and sad and worn, as
their eyes drew them together, with little of
comeliness in their young faces, till love broke
through, and flooded them with beauty ... perhaps
it was of the message to his mother that
Gay was thinking, as timidly she framed his face
in her hands, and softly, as if she feared to bruise
his lips, kissed him.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
